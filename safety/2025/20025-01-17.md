## Notes
* Reviewed idea of a specific object (product) being associated with an action (event).
Concrete objects are instanciations
Abstract objects are types of products
* An abstract object (type) is defined in process.
* AM template define industry requirements for communication and standardization
* It was suggested the abstract model is all that is required for defining proceesses as oppose to the need for a template (plan as suggested by Kate)
* A discussion related to process and requirements identification was started. The issue being how do processes related to a domain, between domains and on a dimenssional level
* Chuck suggested that the methodology is a Functional Design Assusrance process. 
* Suggested that all SC are an assurance concept 
* Assurance confidence levels determine the datails and requirements captured in any moel
* Process engineering concepts are used as part of the AM mapping of processes and requirements 

## Decisions
* The AM works but we need to clearly or define various types and issues.

## Action Items
