## Agenda
* Review AM documents 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JEUtlO51nIO2BABJZXoPFpqqtgehjcd9sHzmx7SpMvk/edit?usp=sharing
* Event Source: concept to identify the related processes, directly associated with event data, so you know where this event came from
* Abstractions between proceses that are the abstraction level and the events that are the entity level
* Event Source is the Action in an SPDX view
* the Event is the instantiation of the Process, the Event produces the Data that is the Evidence that the Process has been fulfilled
* introducting Root element: communality of all items, attributes allow specifically identification of any design element -> already included in SPDX model, used to simplify the model here
* when I look at the evidence produced at the test, this is the evidence I get when looking at the Process/Events definition on slide 6
* if there is an Event, this Event always needs an Agent that performes/triggers this Event
* the artefact that proofs the Event did run, always need the Event associated with it
* Event Data, which is data produced during the Event, is the Evidence (there is no seperate Event Data artefact, all is Evidence)
* to call it Proof, we need the Claim information
* the requirement is the claim we are making, the Event produces the Data, the Evidence is the proof that the Event took place; Proof can be the same as Evidence as long as there is no need for external verfication, if there is the need for verification of Evidence to get Assurance, we need another 
* Assurance is the outcome/Evidence of another Event instantiated from the Process
-> do we need an extra Assurance element here? Or is the Evidence enough and Design Assurance is the whole process described in slide 5
* Example: hello world example with requirement, process and evidence
