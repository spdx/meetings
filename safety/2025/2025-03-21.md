## Attendees
* Steven Carbno
* Alfred Strauch
* Nicole Pappler
* Chuck Wolber
* Ryan Brooks


## Agenda
 * Requirements Class

## Notes
* Steven presents a drawing what he and Alfred have been discussing. Chuck and Nicole agree, that the RequirementVerification would be a good optional addition, but make more sense if it can be connected to Requirement 
* The model mixes Requirements and Actions, which makes according to Nicole and Chuck, no sense here. There are static documents described in Requirements, Testplan etc, and more Actions that are things that happen to create other static documents.
* The Conclusion Action does not work here for software or systems engineering; Chuck sees it more as an Evidence
* There is no rigor that this related. to a specific standard 
==> the RequirementVerification Class is relabled to be a Verification class, that is connected to Requirements with the hasTest relationship
* the property standard: StandardAndSpecification [1] does not work for Chuck and Ryan
==> the Verification class is removed here and the VerificationMethod is moved inside of the Requirements
* Chuck defines the Action as the receipt I get when performing something from a process and created a new work product/artefact
* Conclusion Action was renamed to Evidence Action. with then removing Action, as Evidence is a static work product not an action; Chuck adds that Evidence is a noun.
