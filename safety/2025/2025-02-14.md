## Notes
- documents discussed: 
    * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RiH4WZQ0Fb1vBMOU88NYar__LYzZ08FsxxqxNG-fILc/edit?usp=sharing
    * SC-HW doc from Smart Talk Beacon
- The details captured in the last months are valid, but we need to come up with the generic artefacts
- A process needs to have an agent performing that process
- A test case is then run with a process by an agent as an event (point in time, duration etc.)
- a process is a serious of steps that needs to be run by an agent. It is not limited to a human operator run a process, it also can be software, tooling etc.
- Ryan suggest this one about requirements: https://www.nasa.gov/reference/appendix-c-how-to-write-a-good-requirement/
* requirement levels need to be defined for different domains, the levels are different e.g. for DO 178 and other standards
* on the proprietary the level we need to say which are the levels for the domain. To have a hierachy level as property in requirements, with level numbers for the hierachy level (1 for system level, 2 for a lower level etc. and then have another specification assigning levels for the project/domain)

*Tier 1 requirement: I want a way to pass a written note through the air in class.
