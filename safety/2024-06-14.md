## Agenda
* How can the StrictDoc format be used instead of the SPDX JSON format?
* Relationships of conditional evidence, how can we invalidate a requirement (or mark as not-satisfied) when we have a failed test?
- Test -invalidates- requirement ?
- Test -unmet- requirement ?
- Test -considered_but_unmet- requirement ?
- Test -incomplete- requirement ?
- Test -relatedContradicts - requirement?
- Test -contradictory - requirement?
- Test -contradictsFulfilment - requirement? <- indicates that something is broken, that there is an issue with a requirement, code or test; even if there are two contradicting requirements that make one test fail, this can be used as proof that there aer contracticting requirements.
- Test -deniesFulfilment - requirement? <- might be unnecessary, as we already have complete and incomplete
=> we might need a relationship like Fulfilment ()and contradictsFulfilment for the Evidence to Requirment relationship
=> we also should not have "complete" Relationships by default, at least for Fulfilment <<<--- important for Safety
=> Completeness must be made obligatory for Fulfilment Relationship, can we make Completeness an obligatory field for everything connected to a Requirement  in the Safety Proflie?
=> a set of incomplete Fulfilment Relationships can form a new evidence for a complete Fulfilment, maybe with the "contains" Relationship
