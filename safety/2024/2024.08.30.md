## Notes
- Definition of elements at the specification: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1-draft/
- RDF model at https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1-draft/annexes/rdf-model/
- clarification: component is just another term used for artifact
- New relationship need: mitigatedBy - as in Hazard/risk / mitigatedBy / design/requirement
- using Hazard or Risk, don't mix them up:
    Hazard is the one used by the Safety community
Risk is used also in other context, like business risk
-> a Hazard is a type of Risk
-> Risk is the more general term
- Class is Risk;  Hazard would be a type of risk.  Discussion of other types of risk.

- As homework: Hazard, Risk, classes of them
