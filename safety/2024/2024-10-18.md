## Notes
- continue discussion on ontology
* did the security profile (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0.1/docs/images/model-security.png) consider something similar?
* seems the security group did not consider process
* operations group might consider process, might make sense to talk to them
- continue modeling discussion
* Testplan hierachy (a testplan can have sub-testplans) vs. a requirement directly is subject to multiple testplans
* a testplan is a collection of tests, has a relationship to tests
- Resource could be any spdx element, including actions like set up step. 
- Potential of industry specific profiles to set up tests
- Should a test generate an action?   action pointing to other actions?   
- Single run of a test should require one action.   Evidence is generated from action.
- Test produces a range, therefore we need an action to evaluate the range.   Can break it down to people.  Break it down with as much detail is required. 
- New relationship:  HasTestPlan.

- Context may have impact on role itself, that needs to be further explored. 
- HOMEWORK:  revisit roles for next week.
