# SPDX FuSa Meeting 2024-11-08

## Attendees
- Steven Carbno
- Alfred Strauch
- Nicole Pappler

## Agenda
- Review definitions including requirements, evidence and process
- Discuss next steps related to specification finalization


## Notes
* a specification is a set of steps or a process
* a standard is a formalized specification established and maintained by a body of authority
* processes define specifications, standards or other events ie test plan and test
* a process may be defined by type  ie testing process
* linked across multiple elements
* Is a process an artifact or file?
* Is there a need to have an process as an artifact?
* What is the inheritance level?
* processes need a process for creation  input and output
* a test plan is a process
* a test may be a process
 * standards are technical with specific technical requirements.
 * some standards include processes

## Definitions
* Standards are authoritative
* Specifications are user specific (or group agreed)
* Process is a set of steps that may include standards and/or specifications

* Standards and specifications maps requirements which is a file which maps to artifacts
* Relationship type "hasspecification"  see slide 49
* Processes can "reference" a standard or specification  see slide 49
 * is a process type different from actions - a group of abstract actions - future events
* the incident is the test
* Processes can reference a standard or spefication - no proof
* Proof requires a new process with evidence that one adhered to standard - fullfilment 
- References vs has specification  - processes can only refer to a standard  - standards may not be provable
* What are the element items to be recorded for standards and specification?
* Elements list standards and specification  data objects - no suppliedby - originatedby is better

## Actions
* Review slide 49 with reference to different examples 
* discuss new examples next week
* Requirements group for Linux kernels  contact  Chuck
