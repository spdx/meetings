## Notes and Discussions
* Discussing the details of the artefacts for process, plans, requirements, actions, evidences, tests.. and the relationships they might have to each other
** a process is a future action; processes contain the descriptions of actions
** actions create deliverables, -> every deliverable is an evidence that an action has been performed?
** actions can have follow up actions, like an obligatory action for fulfiling a safety process, with e.g. a creation of an requirement must be followed by the verification action of this requirement and the creation of acceptance criteria and/or the associated test files... and then the adding of these tests to the automation pipeline and so on.
