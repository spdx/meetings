## Attendees

## Agenda
* Homework: Figure out what would be the right relationship between a standard and the intial requirement. Thinking about hunger and a peanut butter sandwich.
Consider modelling the Zephar Reg Structure using Actions

## Notes
* Intent is to link implementation to tesable intent (requirement)
* triangle - equalaterial triangle - independent authoring - the test is the vaildation process
* code covers - does it reach the requirments
* 200o lines of undefined code
* link of sytax to artifacts - key value pairs - lionk - trace parents- data model
* functional safety requirements are requirements in general
* DO 178C standards
* is a contraint defined by risk

* using the word requirement for both product and process descriptions causes confusiion, a differenciation in wording is needed
* a requirement is an expectation
* a requirement in a process is an expectation that something will be done
* a process consists of steps that are performed by humans (that might use tools)? not quite yet
* code could be a process, a yocto build is a process
* distinguish between function and expectation

## Decisions
* To create a document to move the ideas of Action Methodology ahead
* Share ideas with group at FuSa and Hardware group
