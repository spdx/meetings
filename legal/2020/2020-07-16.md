### Agenda

For the agenda we will focus on the (many!) open issues for 3.10: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%223.10+release%22. The target release date for 3.10 is July 31, and this will be the next-to-last call before then, so please get your PRs in if you're aiming to include them in this release.

### Minutes

Reviewing PRs & issues
* 1065: Looking good from what we can tell; merging (woo!)
* 1068: Minor tweaks needed
* should we update the display names of all the CC licenses? maybe someday.
  * https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1072 for discussing this matter
* 1070: Vicky continuing to prep WIP updates to docs for license workflow, to discuss later when ready
* 902: Don't believe this meets our current criteria & don't believe we wish to add it to the exception list (it's an added restriction)
  * Inclined to close now
  * Can always revisit in the future if the exception list ever includes restrictions as well
  * Paul points out that including restrictions in exception list would open up the list to commercial licenses, so would be pretty involved
* 979: Mark has asked the ED to join the conversation
  * Apparently .NET Foundation board meeting now & considering dropping some old licenses
  * WiX Toolset maintainer chimed in on the issue
    * See this as a clarification
    * A'la Linux syscall note
  * Think this is probably good to add as an exception
  * WiX Toolset is a very commonly used project
  * Waiting to see what the .NET Foundation has to say before closing the issue
  * Decide next meeting whether to add
* 720: No update at the moment
  * Hope to have it done for 3.10
* 976: Should be a quick fix
  * Already deprecated the NetBSD variant
  * Steve will send over a PR to deprecate FreeBSD & add more general version
* 988
  * Pretty involved discussion; will require review
  * Paul will have a look (thanks, Paul!)
  * Karsten to add feedback in the thread for versions in their database
  * Relatedly: tzdata is discussing having a SPDX tag for their public domain declaration (very specific text)
* 989: rightsstatement.org
  * Another one for Paul (public domain stuff)
  * May not be anything to do here, but need to review
* 995
  * Was waiting for Jilayne, so will give the issue to her
  * Might have to push this one to 3.11
* 996: Human-readable summary for CC licenses?
  * Discussed that the summary is not the license, and CC clearly separates them
  * Possible option: include URL to human readable in a crossref (PRs welcome)
  * Will leave open to see whether OP wants to chime in, but will probably close next meeting else
* 1007: Also about OpenSSL exceptions
  * Going to Mark since he's working on another related one
* 1022: Related to the Commons Clause matter
  * Not something to resolve in the 3.10 timeframe; punting
* 1047: Steve will try to get to this for 3.10
* 1056: Might be a quick fix
  * License on website has 3 paragraphs but SPDX list only has the first 2
  * Steve dug around & found that paragraph wasn't there originally; added later
  * Add but as optional? Nah
  * Rather add as separate license, since paragraph for fallback license is substantively different
    * A'la the NIST fallback
  * Paul: +1
  * Karsten: Is there a more generic version? Text doesn't include anything ANTLR specific
    * SW: Entire text of "new" license mentions ANTLR, so not generic
    * Add a generic version later if needed
