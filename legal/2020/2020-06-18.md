### Agenda

I'm hoping that we can take a few minutes at the beginning of the meeting to discuss:
1) follow-up from the joint tech/legal team call last week; and
2) the GSoC work and proposal from Smith Tanjong Agbor that was shared with the mailing list earlier today, see https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/message/2821

After that, we will review status updates on the various open issues for 3.10.

### Notes

#### Follow-up from the joint tech/legal team call last week

* Discussing changes for SPDX 3.0
  * General agreement that it makes sense to add a couple of fields
  * Third "distributed license" field is still more contentious
    * "Which license is chosen from these options?"
    * Disagreement whether it's necessary, might cause confusion
    * Tech side has real life use cases for the field already
  * Would be helpful to have a clearer explanation of what the field will mean
    * Understand the use case, but having a hard time articulating how "distributed license" differs from "concluded license".
    * Hoping to get that clarified before it gets into the spec
    * SW will circle back with the tech team on this point
* Were other fields & topics that we couldn't get to on that joint call, so there'll likely be a follow-up call for those

#### GSoC work & proposal

* All license list work happens in the license XML repo
  * The tooling behind the scenes (Gary's done most of the heavy lifting)
  * XML publisher processes into multiple formats (HTML for the website, for instance)
* Student's project
  * Add in validation for the various cross references in the license list
  * Example: AFL-3.0.xml (see license-list-XML/src)
  * `<crossRef>`
  * Old links not removed; added as crossRef instead
  * GSoC would change the publisher tool, not XML repo
    * Publishing process will test each crossRef
    * Valid link? Text of license anywhere in that page?
  * Gary: repo license-list-data contains all the different formats
    * Will add fields to those
  * See mailing list thread for details from Smith: https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/message/2821â€©
  * Nota bene: The XML files won't track what links are/are not valid
    * Will solely become part of the publishing process
    * Will also track at least the timestamp of the last time the links were checked (maybe more)
  * Matching the text?
    * Will use the legal team guidelines on this
    * Anticipate this may result in some feedback about "yes, same text" & false positives
      * Safer to do it this way
      * Have defined the matching guidelines, should be consistent & use those
      * If a lot of false positives, can look at updating the matching guidelines/template
  * Gary: Need feedback on compatibility of existing formats
    * crossRef translated into an array of strings in the publishing process
      * "seeAlso" in the JSON, for instance
    * Suggestion to change to URLs
      * Considering instead leaving seeAlso as strings (not break things for code already using the array), have a different array for crossRefs
      * Duplicate info, but wouldn't break compatibility
    * Team is in favour of this approach
    * Brad: is seeAlso documented?
      * Gary: In the schema, not the spec
      * Would like to get it into the spec, where it's easier to find
      * Any volunteers to do this?

#### 3.10 GitHub issues

* #686
  * GFDL covers multiple use cases
  * Kernel community wants a way to distinguish between these
  * Brought up on a call a few weeks ago
    * Decided: choice of things, create different identifier for each one (#970)
  * Currently GFDL has variants on the list for different versions
  * Will leave those, then add 2 for each instance: "no invariants" and "yes invariants"
  * PR to add those: #1048
  * A lot of license files there & will need a second set of eyes on it
    * Mark A will have a look
  * Would like to get this one landed in the next couple days
    * Kernel community is pretty eager for it
* #1051 PR
  * GLWTPL addition
  * Text will need <p> tags
  * Will need some tags for copyright
    * Steve will add these
  * Test for text of license itself
    * Not doc'd but need that
    * Also, no CI/CD warning for lack of test
      * Steve will ask Gary
* #1053 PR
  * EPICS license
  * Pretty straightforward
  * Again, no test run
    * [vmb: hey, at least it's consistent?]
  * Minor changes needed, but looks good!
  * Won't be merging anything until the CI/CD is fixed
* #979
  * Still working to get stakeholders involved
* #976
  * Started working on it, but unclear whether this is the right strategy
    * Template existing 2-clauses the strategy?
  * Working through the 3-way diff
  * Will write up recommendation soon
    * Probably template existing 2-clause
* #931
  * No examples of it in current use
  * Given that, & past tendency not to include every country's variant of things, what would we like to do?
    * There may be enough older uses of it for adding it to be useful
    * Mark points out that we're often lenient to CC
  * Group tends to agree to add, but Brad would like more info about where old data sets are in use now
  * Comments in issue
