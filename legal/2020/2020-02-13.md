## Minutes

Comments on specific issues are contained in the particular GitHub issue
threads at <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues>

Much of the discussion focused on the request to add CAL-1.0, in issue
953, along with specifics of formatting / how it would be added.
Particularly relevant as the license text instructions incorporate use
of the SPDX identifier. Specific discussion included:

  - where to place license use info – at the top vs. at the bottom (cf
    Apache-2.0, GPL-\*)
  - where to place the identifier, in particular the “Combined Work
    Exception”
  - lead-in describing how to apply the license
  - PR and XML files
