## Minutes

The meeting focused on finalizing issues tagged for the upcoming 3.8
release, and shifting to 3.9 those that are unlikely to be finished for
3.8. Comments on specific issues are contained in the particular GitHub
issue threads at <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues>

A couple of topics were flagged as likely warranting discussion on a
joint legal / tech team call:

1.  regular expressions in license list schema files: concerns have been
    raised about "anything goes" (.+) matches, and would like to discuss
    what alternatives are or are not feasible
2.  license option selections and potential impact on license expression
    syntax -- see <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/970>
    for details
