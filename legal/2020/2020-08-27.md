## Minutes

Issue numbers and assignees from call are listed below

* 1022 - Steve
* 1044 - Steve
  - viewed license list itself as a collection of licenses, not really describing the copyright / license for the list; might specify the license for scripts / code that are in the list.
  - Should be some sort of statement to this effect, something clarifying the intent of the list, perhaps as part of describing the list's purpose, along with e.g. disclaiming liability for state of the "real" license? Clarify curated on a volunteer basis, not necessarily definitive
  - Consider creating an actual "LICENSE" file in the repo, clarifying license for scripts + license for licenses themselves are under whatever they are
* 1054 - Paul
* 1057 - Emmanuel
* 1058 - messaged Mark Atwood in connection with other OpenSSL exception issues
* 1059 - John
* 1060 - Brad
* 1063 - Steve
* 1064 - John
* 1072 - discuss with Jilayne
* 1075 - Paul, might be a one-off
* 1086 - Emmanuel

* SPDX spec - licensing profile
  - Noted from technical team meeting minutes 2020-08-18: appears to be discussion of creating a separate "license scanning tooling" profile
  - Not clear why to have a separate profile, would like to have a discussion about this on a joint team
  - Discussed principles from original SPDX setup
  - Balance of: not wanting to interpret what's required for compliance; also not wanting to imply that all these things are necessary for compliance
  - Should have a statement clarifying that fields in an SPDX document don't necessarily reflect what is necessary / sufficient / required for compliance - better clarification that we aren't providing legal advice

* Action items:
  - Steve / Jilayne / Paul to follow up with core team to align on community's wishes here
  - Consider setting up additional regular joint legal/tech calls
  - Fresh eyes review of website and spec for thoughts on statements re: mission, goals, scope of SPDX => discuss this on next call
