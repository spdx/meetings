### Reviewing 3.11 issues

* #1057
  - Appear to be 2 versions of the LGPL 2.1 text
  - Typically: in markup put an alt tag + regex for each option (an|a brief)
    - This also requires a name property; just pick something unique and descriptive
* Steve: no progress on my issues; super busy lately
* Paul: have some assigned that we can discuss
* #989
  - Request: Add (copy) rights statements to the license list
  - But all the statements are copyright, specifically say not license
  - Not sure where/how we'd add these as licensesâ€¦?
  - SW: Tend to agree don't make sense to add
    - Are some cases of license disclaims added to the list (sqllite)
    - These are more observations about the copyright & something anyone could apple to a work
  - VMB: Suggest they contact Clearly Defined, scancode, etc
  - Paul will comment in the issue explaining the result
* #988
  - CC PD mark
  - Similar situation: doesn't have to be the author to apply this mark
  - Template about the work
  - "free of known copyright restrictions" isn't a license per se
  - SW: List contains CC-PDDC already, but meant to be used by the authors
    - Was an early CC0
  - So the difference is who can apply the thing
  - VMB: Is this in the license inclusion principles?
    - Specifies it's a license, but not who can apply it
    - Opened issue to cover this question: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1096
  - Paul: License defined by OSD, etc. Maybe review 989 or 988 in light of that?
    - These are statements of copyright status according to someone else
    - PM: Yeah, someone's conclusion, like an SPDX file
* #1086
  - xenomai exception to the GPL
  - Exception appears only to apply to the headers of the code (very close to Linux)
  - Already have an exception for the Linux syscall
    - xenomai exception appears based on syscall exception
  - If we add this, it'll be on the exception list
  - No specific mention of exceptions in the inclusion principles, but the principles tend to apply here as well
  - This is only being used in the xenomai project?
    - xenomai.org
    - Real-time framework to use w/Linux
    - Unclear whether it's a single-entity project - corporate, university?
  - AI: Steve is going to ask Kate Stewart whether this is a substantially relevant project (she knows this space well)
