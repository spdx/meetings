## Minutes

### Extant PRs for 3.10

* 976
  * This license isn't actually used by FreeBSD
  * PR keeps the identifier (we don't remove them) but deprecates it; also adds separate identifier for same license but templated
  * Quick fix needed to the templating
* 1079
  * JL: Link we have in  the original license leads to a license w/a 4th paragraph?
  * SW: This IDs a subsection of the project that's under a different license; not part of the license itself
  * JL: Put this in the PR as optional, in case it gets copied elsewhere? Maybe also update the note?
  * SW: Note in the new license
  * SW: Inclined not to add it in as an optional section; not talking about this license, talking about other licenses; open to alternative approaches
  * PM: The license ANTLR declares themselves includes this paragraph
  * VMB: +1 to PM
  * SW: Easy to add this as an optional section
  * SW: In the code itself, the license only includes the first 2 paragraphs; website only place w/4 paragraphs
  * Emmanuel: Reach out to author/steward and ask for their input
* 1080
  * All good to go
* 1081
  * Also good to go

### Open issues

Can we get these done before we release 3.10?

https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/milestone/12

* Several assigned to JL, but she's been pegged past few weeks
* 1046 - VMB to take
* 690 - question about OSI retiring licenses vs. SPDX deprecating licenses
  * may need to clarify what SPDX "deprecating" means, in documentation
  * started deprecating as "don't use this identifier anymore"
  * not about whether license is still in use / retired
  * for CUA-OPL-1.0, has been "retired" by OSI but is not "unapproved"
  * Jilayne to close CUA issue and open new issue
* 1006
  * Need clarification, but it's not urgent
  * Can move to 3.11
  * tied to 690 (and new issue) clarifications on what deprecation means
  * worth adding notes into the deprecated licenses' notes, to explain why they were deprecated and what to use instead
  * JL to add both of these into a sample set, will review on a call
* 995
  * Haven't yet decided to add to the list
  * Structure of license has a lot of configurable entries, complicating matters
  * Submitter doesn't work at MariaDB
    * Looking to speak w/someone there…but trying to remember about what
    * Probably just whether they want to be on the list
  * Someone submitted a PR for this, but not sure whether they work for MariaDB, either
  * JL: Have we applied new license inclusion principles to this?
    * SW: May have talked about that but didn't record it in the issue
    * JL: Should do this before contacting them
    * SW: Think it meets guidelines; source available but not OSS; used by several large projects
      * Item 5 in LIP other factors is "license steward supports or is aware of…"
  * JL will send an email to legal network asking for MariaDB contact
  * General consensus to add it once we contact MariaDB
  * PW: With those complications, would make sense to run past the tech team for input?
    * SW: +1, to ensure will be few snags
    * The complications don't appear to be in the text of the license itself, fwiw
    * JL: Existing uses are well formatted, at least
      * From compliance tooling standpoint though, this is pretty messy
      * Lots of moving targets in this document, for instance the Additional Use grant
      * Will be difficult to have a single identifier to cover all these odd cases
    * SW: Recent discussions around licenses that allow you to select options (GDPL, for instance)
      * Occasional requests for the license stuff to support this
      * If there are only a small number options (2-3), add separate identifiers
      * More than that (like in this case), just add the one identifier
    * JL: Foresee problem where this is added then someone in the tooling area brings this up as an issue
      * Should have an answer ready
      * Put, for instance, something in notes field? "BUSL often has an Additional Use Grant. Please read your specific license…" or some such
      * Suspect lawyers will be comfortable w/this as it's normal for them
