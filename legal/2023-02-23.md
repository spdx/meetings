## Agenda and Notes

### Review Sebastian's PR for CI system / accepted license requests

* #1625: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/pull/1625
* "nice to have" thing - auto-comments re: what happens after a new license is added, but prior to the release occurring
* Some things to confirm re: when and how this triggers
* Sort of relates to license decision template - with info needed to confirm ID / name and other applicable info
  * May need to clarify that separately
* Fedora developers - think that they're waiting to use the ID until after the PR is merged
* Responds to issue, not PR - once it is closed, with the label added


### Review other lingering issues / PRs not addressed in 3.20

* #1771 - adding template for new license requests; agreed to merge and experiment with how it goes, maybe expand docs later to reflect

* #1022 - definition of "exceptions" for purposes of what goes on the Exceptions List
  * in the past, haven't extended to things that _remove_ permissions rather than _add_ them
  * should we acknowledge exceptions, and/or its definition, in the license inclusion principles?
  * or really, higher-level question, should there be "exception inclusion principles" in some fashion?
  * one view: it fits the definition and it isn't already on the list. If we want to mention it briefly, could point to something that is just a restatement of the definition
  * Steve to draft brief language to codify current general practice

## Future topics

* Discuss #1672 and #1651 in light of codified language for Exception List inclusion principles
* Discuss #1452 re: "canonical license text" 
* Discuss #1543 re: any asthetic changes to license list / exception list intros
