## Agenda

1\) update from Collab Summit:

  - went over 2.1 spec, Appendix V will be included - can view now as
    part of entire spec, so if you want to look at it, see:
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/112x3s3g1Qg2tj8bjvIPsqIBlWUp3Sob37cvAx2eiS6U/edit>
  - we all went to talk on Github licensing talk, which was interesting
  - in the afternoon we went over the XML files with legal team plus
    some of tech team. Looked a licenses, how to utilize tools to do
    review and put back into Github repository and then how to maintain
    in a Github repository
      - XML templates to review are now here:
        <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML> - pending pull
        request are to-be-reviewed
      - we talked through various issues, both in XML files and specific
        issues with tags
          - e.g., Kris’ conversion tool didn’t chunk some clauses
            correctly so that some clauses are repeated; not sure how
            many licenses this impacted, but suspects it is a lot, so
            don’t need to be a blocker for review. He’s going to do
            another pass this weekend to check and provide more
            information
      - every license needs review - to check meaning of license is
        impacted in how tags were applied
      - review will require: (generally, process)
          - look at license that has a pull request in
            <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML>
          - if good to go - merge it in; if not tag for further review;
            will have option for people who don’t feel as comfortable
            with using Github
          - want to do a two eyeballs approach - although challenging,
            but ideal for
          - anything challenging needs to be raised on calls or can also
            have a Wiki to record conclusion, but have discussion on
            Github comments and calls
      - Kris to draft process - Paul, Tom, Gary, Jilayne to review -
        will post here:
        <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Templatizing/ReviewXML>
      - Kris also may make a screencast for an example and go through
        one of the licenses
  - timeline: 2 weeks from now - do soft launch of review process,
    following week, do a more divvying up on April 28th legal call
  - still need to make time for discussion based on mailing list topics

Note: there is no SPDX legal call on April 14th - next call is the usual
time on April 28th
