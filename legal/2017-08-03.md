## Agenda

1\) Went through the licenses under consideration / new requests:

  - OSCAT license (new request): provided in German and English
    side-by-side; have some questions on sections 1.4 and 1.5 - will ask
    for more info from requestor and revisit on next call

2\) Discussion around possibilities for implementing GPL-2.0-only / or
later - see
<https://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/or-later-vs-unclear-disambiguation>

  - key issue identified: (input from FSF) GPL by default has “or later”
    in it - in order to use default configuration, have to add + to it;
  - other licenses have default of "or later" yet (EPL family, NPL
    family) don't' necessarily assume EPL-1.0 means 1.0 only?
  - Gary proposed another concept for a solution - add "only" operator,
    where you use neither + or only operators, it's the interpretation
    of the license (will add explanation to above wiki page)
  - all agreed no solution we could think of is elegant and doesn't
    cause problems
  - best result is to have solution that aligns with FSF wants and
    properly recognizes reality of other license with variant text as to
    "only" or "or later" options -- need to build out rest of research
    on that here:
    <https://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/later-version-clauses>
  - discuss with tech team on Tuesday, Aug 8th call

if you have + operator; could then say that nothing, it’s the legal
interpretation of the license;
