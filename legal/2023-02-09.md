## Agenda and Notes

### GSoC proposal for updates to license submission (and file creation) tool

* Draft project: https://github.com/spdx/GSoC/blob/main/2023_ideas.md
* Looking for mentors in addition to Jilayne - knowledge of Django and Python
* Rohit has offered

### update on spec 3.0 and licensing profile - Steve

* can see at https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/licensing-profile (note, have to be in "licensing-profile" branch, not main - eventually there will be a folder for the licensing profile)
* very different format from more prose format of the current spec
* there are Classes and Properties - Classes are things that appear on artifact (e.g., file snippet, file, package) where Properties are applied to Classes
* some places that are placeholders, e.g., exceptions, due to Change Proposal at https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/4 - next step is to have Alexios and Philippe complete PRs on two different implementations options and discuss. this will be PRs on v2.3 in any case, once decision is made, we can sort out timing of getting into spec, whether for a 2.4 version or wait for 3.0
* * JL to reach out to Alexios and Philippe re: timing of completed PRs and follow-up

### closing out 3.20 - issues that need attention:

* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1720 - license only used on fitsio project, does anyone know of more or significance of this project?
  - accepted, decision logged, needs files made
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1731 - similar question as for fitsio

* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1765
  - 
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1746 - I think we need someone else to weigh in? - relates to 1722
  - accepted, decision logged, needs files made
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1722, which I think can be marked as accepted?
  - accepted, decision logged, needs files made
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1773 - markup or new license?

* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1775 - I think just needs final decision on name

  - 

## Future topics

* GitHub bot - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/pull/1625, would need to update date before merging
* would be good to have a walkthrough of this new format / setup for the 3.0 licensing profile
