## FSF License List

picked up where left off last meeting:

  - discussed Guillerme email feedback re: adding all licenses from
    Fedora
  - some of the items listed on Fedora list aren't really licenses,
    though - want licenses on SPDX License List to be fully vetted.
    decided to continue on as we did last meeting to get through the
    whole list and make sure to include some rationale as to why
    anything was decided to not add. Spreadsheet will be posted and
    people not on the call can comment as we go through the rest of the
    list. Once we have gone through the whole list there will be a
    period of time for additional comments before officially adding
    licenses to the list.
  - what is the guiding principle for adding a license/to be on the list
    (other than attributes that need to be obtained)?
      - we probably have some implications of this, but nothing explicit
      - what is open source in this case - is it commonly used open
        source licenses or commonly used licenses on open source
        projects
      - need to have distinction from "freeware," e.g. Sun/Oracle Binary
        Code LIcenses or other licenses that change often and too hard
        to keep up with current versions
      - Mark to make a first draft of this definition/description
  - License naming guideline that came up:
      - for a BSD license derivative - if the common license name uses
        "BSD" then adopt SPDX naming, e.g. 3-clause, then the name of
        the derivative and similar short identifier
      - but where the license has a common name that does not use "BSD"
        then use common name and create short identifier from that name
        (as well as what is used on other lists, e.g. Fedora) â†’ add this
        info license list field guidelines
  - got to line 33 (Do What the F\*ck You Want license) in the
    spreadsheet - Jilayne to update and re-post here and then will
    finish the rest of the list next call.
