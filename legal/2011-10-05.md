## Linux website update

Coming online again slowly, but SPDX site still not up

Issues:

  - we've been sending people there and not up; tools not accessible,
    etc.
      - What are our backup mechanisms if this happened again? No backup
        solution right now, but John Ellis and Martin M. working on this
  - email lists also down - Phil suggested to create google groups to
    preserve email lists, he is working on that now
      - Kate is also setting up IRC

## Update on Discussion w/ Breakout Group on CC-0 & Draft Preamble

  - circulated below draft of preamble for CC-0 for review by group.
    Rockett to take it to Eben Moglen next for his input
  - companies more concerned with "disclaimer" that even though put info
    in here, no responsibility for reliance on info downstream, so may
    need language as such. Could use disclaimer of warranties from GPL
    v3 because it was an attempt to address international perspective
    for this
  - or could say in preamble, "to the extent there is any IP rights at
    all (whether database rights) in any jurisdiction, it's covered by
    CC-0â€¦" and "regardless of whether there is IP coverage, the
    disclaimer paragraph applies to all contributions"
  - maybe good to talk to Eben and get his feedback and go from there
  - See Mark's "rationale" document for a good summarization of the five
    key goals/concerns here
      - Goal of this document is to stand by itself as an explanation
        and to show the comprehensive process that was undertaken to
        make this decision (will be posted)
