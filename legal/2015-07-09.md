  - OCaml-exception requested by Camille Moulin. Want to accept this,
    but noticed it is specific to LGPLv2 (2.0 or 2.1) due to reference
    to clause 3, yet, Github for project, has this same exception text
    with LGPLv3 - <https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/master/LICENSE> -
    which doesn't line-up.
  - 
**4) Standard Headers review (Mark)** - probably only about 15% of
licenses have standard headers; Mark looking through to clean-up, apply
matching, etc. and also provide a recommended header - benefit of
standardizing for other licenses, helpful for tools, etc.

  - feedback on latter idea? why not just use the SPDX identifier?
