## Minutes

Discussed workflow for PRs coming in without a corresponding issue

  - New licenses should always have an issue
  - for minor changes, e.g. markup fixes, PR only is fine
  - CONTRIBUTING file should be expanded to explain this, e.g.:
    non-substantive changes or corrections to existing licenses

Polyform / License Inclusion Principles: Move Polyform to next release
(3.8).

1.  Solidify license inclusion principles as currently exists; point
    website to GitHub docs
2.  Then, discuss in Github issue

Comments during call:

  - Include source available licenses, where intended for widespread
    use, and written by someone “third party” go on list; by companies
    for their own projects, goes in their own namespace
  - Some interest in including source available licenses on the list,
    whether b/c of use case for using that license for one’s own
    project, or to facilitate other FOSS projects being able to avoid
    them
  - Concern about SPDX license list being used as a mechanism to promote
    hitherto-not-heavily-used licenses
  - Maybe another factor is: If a license doesn’t substantially comply,
    then maybe it can still be added but has to meet these other
    criteria: e.g. not company-specific; maintained in a versioned way;
    significant enough use in the wild; and/or license steward’s
    “constellation” of licenses has significant enough use in the wild

Current issue for discussion of updates to license inclusion guidelines:
<https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/925>

Python-2.0: Discussed whether should be split up into separate versioned
licenses; earlier SPDX participant did a whole forensic analysis of
Python license pieces. May not want to re-open but should at least
document earlier decisions that were previously made.
