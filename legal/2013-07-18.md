## Agenda

**1) LinuxCon is coming up\! September 16-18 in New Orleans** Paul,
Phil, Jack will be there; Jason, Dennis are a maybe: Zac not going -
SPDX workgroup will have a room for one of the days; legal team needs to
think about what, if anything, we might cover whilst there

**2) License matching guidelines update** â€“ see new page created re:
process/instructions here:
<http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/License_List/License-templates>
Daniel has posted the first few templates to Google Drive with some
questions (easier than uploading to the wiki), used web conference to
discuss some of the issues that he found and further solidify the
process of providing mark-up guidance.

  - do we need specific markup for license title and copyright notice?
    These things are covered specifically and matching guidelines - is
    that enough or is more specific guidance needed? discussed and
    decided that guidelines are enough
      - further question as to whether official url should have the
        title and copyright notice in the field called "license text"?
  - went over other specifics of how to do markup; Jilayne to update the
    first few licenses as per discussion and then others can use as an
    example; put questions in comments in Google doc. Jilayne/Daniel to
    make sure team members have access to Google docs

**3) SISSL license issue brought on list by Camille: we have SISSL
(version 1.1), but there is also a v1.2**

see: <http://spdx.org/licenses/SISSL>

<http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/sissl_license.html>

<http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/Gridengine_SISSL_license.html>

  - need to determine if v1.2 is indeed a substantively different
    license. from subsequent email:
      - v1.2 omits sections 9 (Limit of Liability), 10 (US End Gov't
        Users) and 11(Miscellaneous)
      - v1.2 adds the following sequence to the end of section 3.1:
        "Additionally, in the event that the Modifications you create do
        not meet therequirements set out in this Section, You agree to
        comply with the Standards requirements set out in Exhibit B."
      - And then also has different text for Exhibit B
  - want to add license to SPDX License List, but how to deal with short
    identifier: v1.1 = "SISSL" if add v1.2 with short identifier,
    "SISSL-1.2" should we also change v1.1 short identifier from "SISSL"
    to "SISSL-1.1"?
      - argument to change: consistent naming, neater, reduces potential
        confusion
      - argument to not change: we have made a goal to not change short
        identifiers unless absolutely necessary; to change a short
        identifier messes up not only SPDX urls, and so forth, but also
        OSI urls and references; no way to know how many SPDX documents
        have been generated using that short identifier as well as
        others use of the SPDX LIcense List
      - discussion that we might want to think about process of changing
        a short identifier, if/when that ever does need to happen;
        redirects, etc.
      - decided to not change SISSL v1.1 short identifier now; argument
        for changing is not compelling enough; can always reconsider
        later if/when we have a process for doing so in place

\- did not get to Ruby License issue on agenda; will cover via email
