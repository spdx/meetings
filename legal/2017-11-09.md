## Agenda

**1) revisit the [only/or later/?
topic](Legal_Team/or-later-vs-unclear-disambiguation "wikilink") - see
discussions from mailing list:
<https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/2017-November/thread.html>**
The notes below includes key points, but not all the discussion:

  - John: issue with plain identifiers is if there is just a copy of
    license with no statement, then there’s statement in license itself
    that any version of GPL can be used; the copy of a version does not
    specify the version by itself. in response to Jilayne’s comparison
    to the license w/binary blob example (where the license would
    prevail with no other info needed in the “files”) - GPL is more
    specific, so not a comparison
  - tension in how license list is used and different fields in spec -
    info in file v. conclusion; and outside an SPDX document - need to
    address both/all
  - Trevor proposed enhancement to XML to flag error if use plain
    identifier (e.g., GPL0-2.0) which might only apply to conclusion
    fields
  - could also add/make NOASSERTION as something that can be used as
    part of license list/expressions (not just within the spec/SPDX
    docs) - this would be helpful for more than this scenario.
  - current proposal is easier for tooling and also leaves room for
    extensibility or other operators (discussion of how proxy clause
    would work, for example)

'''Net sum of call: possible proposals, all of which accommodate 3
options: '''

  - this version only
  - this or any later version
  - I found the license text (of a version) only and no other
    information

1a) “Gary’s proposal” (same one as we’ve been talking about since
beginning of this discussion):

  - keep plain identifiers on license list (remove the word “only” in
    full name); add “only” operator; provide documentation that the
    plain identifier is meant to be used in the instance to show you
    found the text of that license

1b) “operator metadata proposal”

  - Like “Gary's proposal”, but
    [add](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/2017-August/002126.html)
    [`compatibleWith…`](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/2017-November/002308.html)
    [metadata](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/2017-October/002265.html)
    so we can warn in tooling and on the license list that a bare
    `GPL-2.0` is ambiguous and that valid license-expressions SHOULD
    (and [later, with SPDX 3.0,
    MUST](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/2017-November/002311.html))
    supply a versioning operator. In this case, the “license text but no
    grant” case would be require an explicit [`AMBIGUOUS` or `OR-MAYBE`
    operator](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/2017-October/002265.html).

2\) “Paul’s alternative proposal: provide 3 “hard-coded” options on the
license list as follows:

  - change current GPL-2.0 to GPL-2.0-only
  - add GPL-2.0-or-later
  - add GPL-2.0-text-alone (or something along those lines) to be used
    in the instance to show you found the text of that license)

Note: the use of people’s names is only to attribute who initiated the
idea and aide in referring to the proposals :)

Need to carry on discussion of next release preparations, as well as
this topic on mailing list.

Note: next call falls on Thanksgiving, so we will use tech team’s call
time on Tuesday, Nov to carry on discuss so too much time does not
pass\!
