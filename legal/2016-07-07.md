## Agenda

1\) nuclear license discussion for addition to v2.5 release- there are 3
variations and not 2. decided to add all 3

  - add all 3, no templatizing but we recognized that could happen
    later, hence struggled with naming…
  - note difference and similarity in note field as well original (c)
    holder to draw out distinctions

2\) XML license review - went over some of licenses that people had
questions with

  - need someone to look at process and potential changes to existing
    web pages/explanations that will also need to be updated with new
    XML format and Github process - define task, determine time frame
    for this, and assign on next call
  - Gary and Kris not on call, so didn’t discuss deprecated license or
    license exceptions - next call
  - "has acknowledgement" label - include where the acknowledgement is
    conditional or a choice, but still has specific text required in
    that scenario. We will need to include explanation of what the
    acknowledgment tag means, that the acknowledgement may not be
    required in all circumstances
