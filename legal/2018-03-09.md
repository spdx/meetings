Updates to spec and next release planning

  - last merges on 2.1.1 are pretty close; Thomas doing last merges then
    ready. Main change is from Google doc to Github .md file and renders
  - Jack wants an extra week to read the whole thing
  - have already looked at some changes for 2.2 - aim to do that be end
    of summer for Vancouver (Open Source Summit North America) and time
    for announcement) and have a bake-off
  - work on spec 3.0 will come after that, probably 2019
  - all of these are tagged in Github. rule is if incremental and
    doesn’t break anything, then .y release; if going to break things,
    then major release
  - can we link to specific version and section and have that be
    consistent - will change, so will need to update

SPDX License List and it’s related material: better organization to make
it easier to find - should this all go into an Appendix in the Spec? How
to get people to notice and understand SPDX specification fields that
relate to licenses,

SPDX License List “spec” // SPDX License Registry // SPDX License
Collateral // Working with the SPDX License List // SPDX License
Handling Guide or Rules

  - overview inclusion guidance (web)
  - license list (web, spec appendix)
  - exception list (web, spec appendix)
  - expressions (spec appendix)
  - matching guidelines (web only) - but referenced in spec appendix
  - reference to sections of spec that are relevant (spec proper)
  - request a new license instruction (web and Github)
  - how do apply short identifiers in source files (spec appendix only)

implementation:

  - Appendix 1 of spec(and one-pager on website) would have summary of
    above and links
  - each of items in list above would be own web page… (generated from
    file in Github account)
  - would we also want to generate out a .pdf of the entire thing
    together
  - put new .md file here:
    <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/master/chapters> (or a
    separate folder above?) for the above items related to license list
  - for 2.2 release (and might force 3.y of license list

Steve’s license id explanations

  - some of this will be helpful for re-do as described above
  - Jack to give Steve edit rights on website to update “use SPDX” page.
    this page is now one long page, sub-divide different sections

Communicating and explaining relationship and versioning for spec,
license list, matching guidelines, tools, etc. Where/how to update
website to clarify this?

  - once we implement SPDX License Lifestyle Suite, this will be easier.
    Tools have own versioning as it is
  - put on Use / Overview page; Jack to take first stab at re-writing
    with this

Using Github for SPDX: what is our process for different repos, identify
improvements, generate or update documentation

  - ok as is, each repo has its own contributing page
  - main Participate pages on website, needs some updating:
      - main page <https://spdx.org/participate>
      - each page for sub-groups; Philippe on tech page; Jack on
        outreach; Jilayne on legal

Adding more licenses to SPDX License List: from the Linux kernel, other
licenses

  - \~10 licenses for kernel to request to add; Dennis and Philippe to
    add via Github in next week, discuss on mailing list as needed (in
    time for 3.1 release
  - Steve is doing scanning on LF projects, will also keep eye out for
    new licenses to add
  - reach out to FreeBSD (? Jack)
  - add example of how to do LicenseRef for licenses not on SPDX License
    List
  - Sun/Oracle binary licenses and a few from Microsoft - that are not
    open source, but apply to very common components - versioning issue,
    not open source, change randomly. would be good to have a write-up
    on this issue
  - is there a limit to add more open source licenses or how long we
    want the license list to be?
      - need updated tool to match if it gets much longer
      - may want to make sure Github process works before we open flood
        gates, getting used to new model first
      - what about stuff not used much?
      - if it can be easily identified, add it - that’s what list is for
  - agreed on timeline/approach:
      - work on 3.1 additional licenses as noted
      - documentation/example on how to use LicenseRef - easier when
        using SPDX doc, but hard to use when using outside of that. want
        to encourage use of SPDX identifiers
      - focus on web matching tool (and using Github for new license
        more easily)
      - tool to generate XML (original tool that Kris wrote, won’t work)
        - long term plan to have this; maybe web-based where fill in
        boxes? (talk to Gary and Trevor on where we are at with this,
        who can help from tech team)
      - then can add more licenses, prioritize open source - then
        discuss other options (again)

<!-- end list -->

  - SPDX “relaxed” - some people are providing SPDX documents that lack
    some of mandatory fields, thus are not SPDX compliant, but this is
    still useful info. Should we have a “relaxed” option or some kind of
    grading for SPDX documents to encourage more use?
      - don’t really have quorum for this discussion
      - discussed where this is coming from
      - Yev suggested that any mandatory field that allows NOASSERTION
        could be optional
      - Philippe has example of documents with useful info tracking on
        SPDX but not mandatory fields
  - action: do comparison of Philippe’s example, Yev’s suggestion
    against mandatory list -
    <https://spdx.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/files/spdx_onepager.pdf>
  - consider publishing examples
