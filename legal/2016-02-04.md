## Agenda

1\) Quick update from general call; good agenda shaping up for Collab
Summit for end of March

2\) New license requests: tracked on Google spreadsheet, short summary
of discussion included here:

  - FSF All Permissive License (submitted by Didier Verna) - accepted
    for 2.4. Noted that it comes from FSF, so added "FSF" to name and
    used a short identifier following the same pattern as other
    permissive FSF notices already on list
  - Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data - had asked requestor for
    info about where it's used, but have not heard any response.
    discussed that it is not a s/w license per se, but for data, but we
    have other licenses for data and documentation that are also open.
    decided to add it
  - Secure Messaging Protocol Public License - approved

3\) various updates:

  - Markup proposal discussion got pushed back to Feb 9 (JL to send
    invite; check with Kris first
  - Reminder to check Gary's proposal in Google doc:
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/115Lis1SJV7Rp-XuNjIysU61urzFGjUOBPqEdVyGLsfI/edit>
      - review and be prepared to comment for next call on Feb 18
  - update from Kate re: FOSDEM - she spent much of two days in legal
    and policy dev room which was, once again, full\!\! See the schedule
    here:
    <https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/legal_and_policy_issues/>
    Should be recordings of all talks, will post link when available
    here: <http://video.fosdem.org/2016/h2213/> and
    <http://video.fosdem.org/2016/ud2218a/>
      - One talk on Saturday discussed penetration of license list short
        identifiers - will probably have for guest speaker on next
        general call
      - Stefano advocated for shared database of SPDX docs, e.g.,
        DebSources (Matt Germonprez at UNO also advocating this)
      - Keynote on Sunday morning by Richard Stallman (Kate got locked
        out\!)
      - Kate also spoke with Richard and Stefano about sequencing for
        OSI approved licenses and SPDX. Kate is following-up with them
        to confirm
