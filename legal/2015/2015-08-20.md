## Agenda

1\) Update from LinuxCon - quick thoughts from Mark, but will do bigger
update next call

  - Biggest SPDX-related meeting was the bakeoff went well, good
    feedback from that.
  - Gary gave his presentation - good showing there.
  - Mark gave a talk too, but not related to SPDX directly. Premise was:
    great sharing is happening, but if forget to include license info -
    the code ceases to be "open". And "grading" of projects by tool by
    WindRiver, showing example of Apache and FSF projects who get A+

2\) Headers project: Mark working on drafting summary of issue and
proposal; will send to group once in more firm, for review

  - discussed some further thoughts on Mark's proposal
  - discussed markup for standard headers: about 51 licneses with
    standard headers; HTML is not formatting correclty on web pages -
    this will be fixed as of 2.2 release at end of September
  - about 25 standard headers need markup, many of which have copyright
    notices
  - what about copyright notices? should they be in license text and
    headers at all? there is a separate field in SPDX spec for copyright
    notices, and matching guideline \#10
    <http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines> says to
    ignore copyright notice for purposes of matching license text, so
    maybe
  - \* oddball case: when the copyright notice is not at top of license
    or header, but in middle of or part of text - previously decided
    that in this case, the copyright notice would get markup
  - \* oddball case: when the license itself has copyright notice -
    previously decided that this would not get markup and be part of
    match. (should the matching guideline re: copyright notices mention
    this scenario?)
  - \* for discussion on next legal call...
  - for replaceable text in standard headers, will add same markup as
    with licenses and use whatever is "original" (even if a blank line)
    as the example or original text when displayed on HTML pages

Next call agenda:

  - more thorough update from LinuxCon
  - copyright notice discussion
  - discuss updates to new page on license matching related proposals
    (please review page in advance and add to Wiki page in meantime)
