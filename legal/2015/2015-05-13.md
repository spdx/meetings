## Agenda

**1) Standard Headers issues**

  - overview of what the Standard Header field is and the usefulness of
    it and overview of issues
  - how do we accommodate for any L/GPL+ via the standard header now
    that we have license expression "+" operator? is this even a
    problem?
  - add markup indicating "or later" as omitable with a comment or note
    that if that language is present, then use GPL-2.0+
      - where to put this note or comment? use existing Note field (we
        could add field later if needed, but doesn't seem necessary now)
  - for standard headers with variable text fields, use varible markup
    there too
  - adding markup to the Standard Header may also mean some edits to
    Matching Guidelines - review
  - Mark will do this work: 1) general review of Standard Headers for
    correctness; 2) add markup (variable and omitable); 3) add Note for
    GNU licenses re: "or later" and 4) will also review licenses that
    have more than one option for Standard Header; if it can't be dealt
    with via markup, then will raise on Legal call

**2) Adding more license exceptions**

  - Paul checked with Tech team as to whether adding more exceptions for
    2.1 and end of June would be okay - Tech team affirmed :)

**3) Package level license identification**

  - Mark proposal: sometimes you might have various bits of a package
    under different licenses (e.g., main code under GPL; libraries under
    LGPL; documentation under FDL) - no way to accurately express this,
    b/c "and" is not really appropriate or comfortable (assuming "and"
    means all licenses apply to all files in package). Issue is at
    package level, not at file level. Should we have a new operator to
    indicate different licenses apply to different parts of the package
    that is not in an "and" way via a ";"? discussed this; will need
    further dedicated discussion

4\) Joint call with Tech team to discuss NONE / NOASSERTION defintions
and use in Spec

  - legal would probably join regular scheduled TEch team calls, maybe
    Tuesday, May 26 or June 2 at 10am PST
  - a couple people may not be available at either of these dates; check
    with Tech team leads and decide
