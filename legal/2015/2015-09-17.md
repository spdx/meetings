        - anyone going? Jilayne, Kate

\- participating via phone or conference might be hard, but Kate will
look into getting a phone in the room. considering it is challenging to
follow along remotely. Otherwise, we’ll take notes.

  - c) Working on proposal for pull request process for license list
    templates (and possibly other aspects of changes to license list) -
    will submit a full proposal to legal team when something more
    concrete is ready
    (see http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal\_Team/Minutes/2015-08-06 for
    initial discussion/reference)

'''2) SPDX License List v2.2 is scheduled to be released at the end of
this month\! ''' 

  - a) Additions to license list. We got some answers back from Fedora
    on licenses on their list we wanted to add, but couldn’t find text
    for, etc. Original question/issue and response listed here, with
    decision from today's call:
      - Interbase Public License / Interbase -
        <http://www.borland.com/devsupport/interbase/opensource/IPL.html> -
        link broken, can’t find license. Does Fedora have it archived
        somewhere? Is this still used / do we need to add to SPDX-LL?
        FEDORA: Here is an archived copy:
        <https://web.archive.org/web/20060319014854/http://info.borland.com/devsupport/interbase/opensource/IPL.html>
        Firebird is still under this license, still used in Fedora.
          - DECISION: to add. no markup needed.
      - Sendmail License / Sendmail /
         http://www.sendmail.org/ftp/LICENSE - link from Fedora site
        does not go to license. We intend to add, but wanted to confirm
        that we have the correct license that you meant due to broken
        link - can you confirm that this the correct license here:
        <http://www.sendmail.com/pdfs/open_source/sendmail_license.pdf> FEDORA:
        That is the correct sendmail license. We have updated our link.
          - DECISION: to add. no markup needed.
      - Crystal Stacker License / Crystal Stacker -
         https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/CrystalStacker -
        license on Fedora site does not match license in download. (full
        explanation was in previous email thread) - please review and
        see if you agree with the recommendation at the end of the email
        here
        <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.licenses.spdx.legal/779/match=crystal>
        FEDORA: Updated the Crystal Stacker entry in the Fedora license
        list to add the missing disclaimer text. License now matches
        license in download. I do not believe there is a different
        source license vs binary license here.
          - DECISION: add it as Fedora has it.

<!-- end list -->

  - b) To continue (pick back up) our momentum for adding license
    exceptions, please review the 5 license exceptions highlighted in
    light green
    here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11AKxLBoN\_VXM32OmDTk2hKeYExKzsnPjAVM7rLstQ8s/edit?pli=1\#gid=0 for
    potentially adding to v2.2 (see spreadsheet for full info, summary
    here:)
      - DigiRule-FOSS-exception - ADD
      - Fawkes exception - ADD
      - Oracle FOSS exception - there are two-ish. Sam has info that the
        one in row 1 is the short form of the long form in row 7 (from
        Sam’s email in July 2, 2015). need to review further, on hold
      - Franz Lisp - don’t add, old and no one has seen it in the wild
      - OpenVPN OpenSSL - ADD
      - Also discussed whether all exceptions on this list should be
        added. Many of these were from research done to collect various
        exceptions and not necessarily requested by anyone. As such, we
        have tried to add the most common ones, but people should review
        list and if they want to champion something that we didn’t add,
        then please do so.

<!-- end list -->

  - c) Also, let’s discuss a couple items related to existing exceptions
    that we didn’t quite get to for v2.1:
      - WxWindows - the text in the exception we have versus what is on
        the OSI site is not the same\!\! The only differences are:
        we have "3.1" instead of "3.0" in the first clause; and "your"
        instead of "the user's" in the second clause.
        See http://opensource.org/licenses/WXwindows and http://spdx.org/licenses/WxWindows-exception-3.1.html -
        what we have is consistent with what is
        here: https://www.wxwidgets.org/about/licence/ - should we
        accommodate this difference somehow?
          - DECISION: leave as we have it, since it’s current with the
            Wx website. let OSI know there is discrepancy and see what
            they have to say
      - Classpath-exception-2.0 - why do we have 2.0 and the note saying
        it’s typically used with GPL-2.0? the Fedora example has
        it being used with all GPL versions and there doesn’t seem to
        have other versions. worth removing the “2.0” in the
        short identifier?
          - DECISION: remove note about “typically used with GPLv2”,
            leave short identifier as is

**3) License matching templates/markup: ** We have a task to add markup
to some of the standard headers and have also had input to add/edit
markup on existing licenses.  As a result of the latter, it has been
raised that perhaps the markup could be improved. Before adding more
markup (to standard headers, license text or both), it seemed prudent to
start a discussion as to whether the existing markup is effective.
 Please ponder the following questions:

  - a) have you used the existing markup for matching purposes? if no,
    why not? if yes, has it been helpful/effective?  Could it be
    improved, and if so, how? (this will likely involve putting forward
    a proposal for review)
  - there were already various emails with feedback to this end, but we
    did not have time to discuss further on this call. We will pick this
    up on the next call and will also raise this discussion at the
    Supply Chain Mini-Summit in Dublin, Thursday afternoon, Oct 8
      - Please also add thoughts (preferably in a new section or with
        your initials if added to others)
        here: http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal\_Team/Templatizing

**other notes:**

  - Jilayne needs to use headphones on calls (otherwise there is an
    annoying echo for everyone else)
