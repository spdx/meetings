  * first exposure with open source!

* opportunities to discuss / present to university students - both law students / IP law society and comp sci students

* #2017: MIT-Khronos: discussed on call, agreed to add (1) markup to MIT for "Software" vs. "Materials", and (2) new MIT-Khronos license for the variant with the additional paragraph

* #2029 and #2030: actually appear to match to HPND and HPND-sell-variant; Steve to confirm

* #2019: difference of "all copies" vs. "all source code copies" warrants doing this as a separate license identifier; use as "HP-1989" for identifier

* #2020: good with adding as another variant of the matching language for the contributor names

* #2024: agreed to use check-cvs as identifier

## Future topics
