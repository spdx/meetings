## Agenda

**1) LinuxCon, various other updates, administrative stuff**

  - Dennis to take lead on whole license request process (Dennis gone
    8/4 - 8/22, so Jilayne will cover during that time)
  - Jilayne to take lead on organizing time for LinuxCon and changes
    needed to website (on LIcense List page, specifically, e.g. add
    standard header field to web page; move old license lists to git,
    issue tracking there?)
  - Scott to take lead on License Matching Guidelines process
  - Paul to continue with first pass on Fedora list
  - Tom Vidal still working on GPL exceptions list, just needs to make
    it more presentable and will send along via email soon; has about 17
    exceptions on list so far

<!-- end list -->

  - LinuxCon: Jilayne, Mark, Phil, Paul, Scott - will be at Zac, Dennis
    not coming
      - license list or legal team issues that are critical to release
        of v1.2 of the spec? thing to do before LinuxCon versus things
        to do AT LinuxCon
          - issue of being able to refer to which version of the license
            list was used when the SPDX file was generated; need to add
            field in spec and need to add way to better access older
            version of license list - Mark to take lead on this topic
          - proposal to have spdx.org always have most current version
            of license list and then have a git repository with download
            for current and old versions; "new" website is currently
            lacking a link to download the .zip file with the license
            list, so this would also fix that issue
          - what about suggestion for tagging source code files (using
            SPDX short identifier) - technical team looking at this in
            light of recent U-Boot use of same; Jack following this one

**2) review requested license additions**: see
<http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/License_List/Licenses_Under_Consideration>

  - Ruby License (see discussion cut and pasted below from previous
    email) - Ruby license is already on SPDX-LL, but the license text
    includes the "notice" stating the disjunctive choices; support to
    revise license text to remove the notice, so that it's license text
    only (otherwise, woudl require two license, the only difference
    being this statement)
  - IBM PowerPC Initialization and Boot Software - ADD (do not include
    notice at top stating disjunctive option, as per Ruby decision)
  - Unlicense (http://unlicense.org/) - ADD

**3) License List Matching Guidelines**

  - Scott to take lead on this
  - revisit assignments / update from
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Minutes/2013-06-20>
      - Zac will take on GNU family of licenses by next call
      - Scott will take on Apache 2.0 and MPL family by next call
      - Jilayne will post a check-off list and add access (Jilayne to
        add: Scott, Tom V., Dennis, and whoever else on call who isn't
        on there now)

**4) Fedora List**

  - decided to also move this to a publicly available Google doc -
    Jilayne to put this up and send out invites; this way anyone can
    update or can be updated as we discuss and then no need to email
    around documents
  - list of 250 licenses; Paul has made initial pass on about 150\! he's
    offered to keep going
  - team to start considering licenses in following order;

<!-- end list -->

1.  on Fedora list, not on SPDX LL (and no short identifier "issue")
2.  license on either or both lists with a short identifier "issue'
    (i.e. short identifier is different on one list than other, or
    Fedora uses short identifier to refer to what SPDX LL considers
    different licenses
