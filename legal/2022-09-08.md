## Notes

### quick look at #1603 - x11vnc-openssl-exception
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1603
* agreed to add

### discuss release process, cadence and documentation
* Steve's notes and also https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1568 and https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1569
* Frequency of releases: balancing:
  * time involved to push the release
  * SPDX document creators
  * expectations for license request submitters (especially Fedora community, etc.)
  * downstream users of license list (e.g. re-packagers of license list into other packages)
* Could consider periodically doing interim releases if there's a heavier load of licenses in one release
* Steve to discuss with Gary re: adding full release documentation to repo; if not, then at least summary
* Also something like general FAQ on how the release process works


### GitHub bot
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/pull/1625
* Auto-responder to notify the submitter about license list release process (e.g. "up to three months from now") if issue is BOTH tagged as "Accepted" AND subsequently closed

### review other documentation tasks for 3.19
* regular expressions in license templates: discussed, would be good to add examples: see https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1289

## Future topics
* follow-up on GitHub bot
* review rest of license submission tool edits after Jilayne returns
