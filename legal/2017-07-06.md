## Agenda

1\) Linus’ note identifier conversation continuation from last call

  - question from last call as to having the correct text
    <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/COPYING>
    - this is the right text; the link originally provided in the
    request was not in Linus’ Git tree, 12 years old and had been copied
    and put it on a weblink; has been removed
  - discussion as to name: addition of “syscall” to help clarify the
    context
  - “note” was what it was called at time, instead of “exception” as
    that term was not widely used at the time, but “exception” is in all
    other identifiers currently.
  - acknowledged that consistency is good, but could end up with GPL-3.0
    additional permissions in future that might not be called
    “exception”
  - strong preference to honor the language that Linus came up with and
    used there
  - need to update language on top of page for exceptions list to be
    more explanatory - this would help clarify and be less constrained
    to the word “exception”
  - short identifier decided as: “Linux-syscall-note”

2\) XML Update

  - update from Gary on preview website has been updated and can now see
    updated bullet issue
  - request on tech call to use XML format on license that are not on
    SPDX License List (e.g., LicenseRef- ) such that they can add some
    of properties to license text in that section of spec; also
    standardizing license XML so others can have own list - to be
    discussed

3\) GPL only / or later

  - wiki page on this updated -
    <https://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/or-later-vs-unclear-disambiguation>
  - most likely path of implementation for GPL-\#-only short identifier
    is by removing + operator, but need to investigate other licenses
  - started to capture examples of other licenses with “other version”
    language; need help here. Will put this on a separate page and in
    table format
  - looked at EPL family by way of example, which does not accommodate
    an “only” option and essentially is “or later” no matter what as the
    license is written
  - more licenses to look at and more discussion needed before we can
    make this move
