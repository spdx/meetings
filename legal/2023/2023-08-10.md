* Ria Schalnat
* Steve Winslow

## Agenda and Notes

### Discussing scope of coverage

* Does the SPDX license list try too hard to cover ever little variant of each license?
* Jilayne: When LL started, pulled initially from lists like OSI and Fedora.
* Discussion regarding purpose of SPDX license list; should something be done to limit the sprawl of too many variants; whether and how do namespaces play into this
* Current process: (1) review and community approval; (2) submit PR with XML + test text
* Approval for step 1 takes 3 approvers, at least 2 of whom are lawyers; more recently, for licenses used in a major distro where OSS principles are evaluated (focused initially on Fedora and Debian), now only requiring 2 approvers
* Significant concern is: can we trust the tooling to confirm that a new license doesn't match, using markup, to something already on the license list?
* Not having duplication is important. We try not to deprecate things lightly
* Ria: If the copyright owner is willing to relicense to a standard license, would we decide not to assign it a separate ID?
* Jilayne: It depends, on what's needed or desired by the community
* Ria: would be very helpful to consider (1) whether expansion to the matching guidelines would help in reducing unnecessary added identifiers; and (2) a walkthrough of the tool(s) to understand how much we can trust what they're telling us, regarding similarity of licenses and requests
