## Agenda and Notes

### New Participants

* Vedant Jolly - undergrad in CS, applied for GSoC, welcome!

### Announcements

* Fedora - updating packages to use SPDX IDs; scheduled a hackfest to speed up the process and to ask questions directly; hope to have SPDX folks attend so that decisions can be made in real time for adding licenses
* Will be on April 26th, morning Eastern time; details forthcoming to legal and tech mailing lists

### XML questions

* PR #1913 - lines consisting of ----------- etc.: can `<optional>` tags be removed
  * Gary: similar to matching guidelines: would document it in the matching guidelines: three or more repeating characters of ---, ===, ___ should be ignored
  * Should add a matching guideline for that
  * Documentation: In XML fields docs, make a note of this -- don't need the `<optional>` tags around them

* PR #1909: regular expression for matching to names
  * Gary: this RE is correct and more conservative, probably don't need to fix in prior ones

* PR #1914: updating documentation re: XML entities

### 3.21 Licenses and Exceptions - looked at the following:
* #1913: Steve to review now failing PR for Xdebug
* #1798 Google WebM decision from last meeting - Steve has reached out to Google as FYI, if won't respond by couple weeks, then will create PR to add
  * Concern re: combining them: tooling might not be able to reasonably handle one license spread across two files
  * Open question re: standalong entries for patent licenses: what would be the "inclusion principles" for these?
  * Jilayne: could we make WebM patent license an "Exception", and include in notes that we're not opining on legal interpretation of whether the exception is "needed"?
  * Steve: treating WebM patent license as an Exception to go after a `WITH` may change the meaning of BSD-3-Clause's potential "implicit" patent license
  * Richard: may have external-to-SPDX consequences in understandings or interpretations of this
  * Jilayne: could we state that we don't intend to opine on the inclusion of patent licenses and its purposes / effectiveness?
    * Paul: same disclaimer concept would kind of apply to all licenses re: intent -- may want to stay away from that
    * Mark: various kinds of IP might apply; might be worth stating somewhere that e.g. "not opining on whether e.g. APIs are copyrightable"
    * Jilayne: maybe state in a generalized way, not as to particular licenses or terms
  * Steve: any equivalent community definitions for what constitutes an "open patent license", comparable to e.g. OSD / FSF definition for software, etc.?
  * Do we want to be more "liberal" when it comes to corner cases on whether something is an "exception" or "additional permission"?

## Future topics

* Need to summarize options re: WebM and Adobe patent licenses, and circulate to mailing list
* Next call April 27: earmark for final discussion on Change Proposal https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/4
