## Agenda and Notes

### Mark - AOM Patent License
* https://aomedia.org/license/patent-license/
* Mark: Being used by AV1 codec - BSD-3-Clause-Clear together with this patent license. Appropriate to add this as a license, or as a license modifier?
* Discussion about differences between copyright licenses and patent licenses
* Mark to submit for community review and consideration as a standalone license (not an exception)
* Steve: noted that the license inclusion principles might provide a mechanism for evaluating the way that AOM is currently using it, as a combined BSD-3-Clause-Clear together with the patent license. But SPDX License inclusion principles don't currently give a way to evaluate standalone patent licenses

### Sebastian - License Expression Syntax
* Question about having a different formal grammar for LicenseRef for SPDX 3.0?
* Sebastian - mentioned that Alexios is working on a proposal for a more simplified grammar 
* canonical serialization will have one and only one way of expressing something. some fields are easy for this (e.g., date and time), but license expression is complex, so need rules to a bare minimum, e.g., expanding out brackets, removing white space?
  * e.g. Zlib AND Zlib AND Zlib - not incorrect, should this be "corrected"? 
  * Richard: I don't think SPDX should make opinions on reducibility of valid license expressions 
  * Steve: license expressions are more flexible than necessarily what we might think "makes sense" -- if an expression creator chooses something odd, that's fine. Downstream users of the SPDX document can readjust as they see fit, but 
* Discussed:
  * Canonicalisation should not try to reduce or change expression contents, and should not reorder
  * RDF expression should also preserve ordering in e.g. a list or array rather than a container

### Jilayne - GSoC update
* project for SPDX online tools' license submission tool: https://github.com/spdx/GSoC/blob/main/2023_ideas.md#spdx-license-submission-online-tool---increase-functionality
  * issues list: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues
* Would like for GSoC participants to include maintainability / sustainability, e.g. details and documentation about how to improve and make adjustments over time

### Jilayne - Requesting new licenses
* Issue submission options at https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/new/choose:
  * May want to reorder so that the SPDX Online Tool option is first
  * May want to include disclaimer for Issue Template option, to make it clearer about effect on the later license creation through online tools
* Sebastian: If creating license files is something people find difficult via XML / Git, then could factor out the license editor part into a separate tool
  * Jilayne: exists, at https://tools.spdx.org/app/xml_upload/
* For better carving out the XML editor piece of functionality - Jilayne and/or Sebastian can submit an issue in the Online Tools repo and the GSoC students (or others) _might_ pick it up

## Future topics

* Pulling forward from 2023-02-23:
  * Discuss #1672 and #1651 in light of codified language for Exception List inclusion principles
  * Discuss #1452 re: "canonical license text" 
  * Discuss #1543 re: any asthetic changes to license list / exception list intros
