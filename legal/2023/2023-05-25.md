### GSoC presentation and discussion
* We will have Vedant Jolly - our GSoC student working on improvements and increased functionality for the SPDX license submission tool. You can see his proposal here: https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/message/3378 
* Will be helpful to include creation of .txt files along with .xml for people who use the online tools to create PRs
* Also add some UI changes to the request submission form to designate differences between licenses vs. exceptions => and carry this through into the XML editor, so that it chooses the correct tag
* better testing to catch stuff earlier and reduce cycles on fixing stuff
