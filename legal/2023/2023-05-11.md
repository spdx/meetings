## Agenda and Notes

### Upcoming Fedora hackfest

* Wednesday, May 17th at 10AM-2PM Eastern US time at https://meet.google.com/fiu-jdzq-mws
* going over a subset of Fedora packages to update license info in spec file to SPDX expressions

### Discuss SPDX 3.0 Licensing Profile
* Steve gave presentation at Open Source Summit on Tuesday, did on call
* major changes to how SPDX spec is organized and expressed; current spec is all together - criticism of this is that it's confusing and seems too complicated. 
* separate out different use cases, referred to as "profiles" - have core set of fields that apply across the board and then add whatever use case you are most interesting in, e.g., licensing, security, etc. and focus on use case you are most interesting in
* SPDX-3 repo -https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/main/model/Licensing  has different folder and series of markdown files, each file defining things in a more machine-readable way than human readable way, similar to how our XML files are the upstream source of the SPDX License List
* names that were always there for various fields are now more visible 
* noted new field for AdditionRef- to capture additional text that is not a standalone license, but intended to modify a license and not on the SPDX exception list
* new profile will consolidate properties that can be applied across packages, files, snippets (instead of separate fields for each)
* open issues to be discussed on upcoming SPDX legal or joint calls:
    * see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AProfile%3ALicensing
    * e.g., if or how should NONE and NOASSERTION be used in license combinations/expressions
* tour of repo for licensing profile - looks very different than when what we are used to from existing format
    * RDF model has always been there, but has been maintained as separate thing from what we think of as the SPDX spec, human readable format; 3.0 will reduce to one upstream that then can generate different formats (so to speak) by spec parser that creates human readable, RDF
    * 3.0 repo has "model" and "serialization"
        * model directly is different "profiles" - what is the data shaped like
        * serialization is once you have the data, how do you "save it to disk" in whatever format you want (SPDX file in JSON, RDF, etc.) 
    * model/Software --> defines a set of concepts/objects, e.g., package, file, snippet - will look familiar. And what are the set of properties each object has
    * properties apply to classes - e.g. ConcludedLicense defined in Software Properties now, b/c properties of Software artifact, but hoping will get moved back around to Licensing model so all licensing stuff is together, organizationally
    * Licensing model then has Properties and Classes
    

### Follow up on 3.21 issues and PRs

* Jilayne will send list of key issues to the mailing list, please review and weigh in on the issue threads!

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

* Getting a GSoC student who will help with improving the license submission tools
* Jilayne and Rohit will be mentoring
* The legal team as a whole should help to weigh in with feedback, comments on the license submission tools
* One goal: enable automating the creation of the XML files as much as possible
* Timeframe: 12 weeks, currently in community bonding period; starting coding in June
* Student is in India, so timezone differences will be challenging, but may try to include in a future call
  - Maybe for next call, May 25th?

## Future topics

* Steve to set up separate calls for Licensing profile - work with Kate and Gary; lean towards Legal Team call time if possible
* Discuss Public Domain tagging - wait until June
