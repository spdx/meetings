## Agenda and Notes

### Discuss Change Proposal for custom exceptions / additions: 

* Thread: https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/4
* Minutes from prior Legal Team discussion (2023-01-12): https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/main/legal/2023-01-12.md
* Steve began with a summary of comments on change proposal and prior discussion
* Alexios: Change Proposal was for a way to record something on the right side of WITH. Requested two possiiblities, ExceptionRef- and AdditionRef-
* Thomas: clarify re: whether this is about adding BOTH ExceptionRef- and AdditionRef-, just of them, choice of naming really. 
* Karsten: also concerns re: use of "addition" b/c of meaning, especially for non-native English speakers, which Thomas also agreed to
* Jilayne: Agreed that we should _not_ use "ExceptionRef-" for this b/c it could be confusing b/c we have a meaning for exception criteria and this could be used for things that do not meet that critieria. We can then debate "AdditionalRef-" or "ModifierRef-" or something else
* Alexios: expect this one to be used for _additional text_ -- e.g. license that deletes a paragraph, wouldn't be using a "WITH" expression.
* Steve - agreed; pointed to Richard's comment at https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/4#issuecomment-1488762757 listing particular examples of use cases for this
* Jilayne: consensus to add ability to do this, regardless of what we're naming it, including the examples from Richard's comment
* Now down to naming:
  * proposal: "AdditionRef-"
  * Karsten, Thomas: "ModifierRef-"
  * Mike: what about "AdditionalRef-"?
* Jilayne: either way, it will need to be captured somewhere not just in the license expression syntax, but also in the SPDX spec properties for defining custom licenses - e.g. Clause 10 in SPDX 2.3, https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/other-licensing-information-detected/
* Gary: Holding up completing the SPDX 3.0 licensing profile in part on this decision. Suggest deciding on this, re: what the text should look like; then that'll feed into the SPDX 3.0 spec structure
* Discussed AddRef as verb, AdditionRef as noun, AdditionalRef as adjective
* other suggestions of SuppRef-, ExtraRef-, OtherRef-
* Consensus on accepting proposal using AdditionRef- as the prefix
* Next steps: incorporate this into SPDX 3.0 structure (don't edit 2.3 b/c that could be confusing)
