Extra meeting – demo from Umang Taneja on GSoC 2019 License Submission
Tool improvements

Developing the new features included the following tasks:

1.  Create API for license submittal feature
2.  Create SPDX license matcher =\> tool to match submitted license
    against SPDX license list. Takes into account SPDX matching
    guidelines
3.  Check if license already present on license list
4.  Check whether license is not yet approved / is rejected – looks only
    at what’s been submitted through the tool
5.  Improve XML generating algorithm and license submittal feature –
    added Beautify button inside tools. In process, breaks if license
    text itself has angle bracket tags
6.  Check for close matches, show diff, ask user if changes are
    substantial. Still working on PR

Suggestions:

  - Diff to matching – include button / link to matching guidelines;
    include telling submitter which license is matching
  - Diff against other licenses – can it be word-by-word rather than
    full line? Longer-term fix, would involve changing the full
    algorithm
