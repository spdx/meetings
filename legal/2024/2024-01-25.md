  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xqSwTfJJ7btkhbblrIAZxOxv0iZPmAMGar9rU7DLKC8/edit  
  - will keep there given other priorities currently
  - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-match.md
  - also want to clarify the BSD-3-Clause markup at some point

- bzip2-1.0.6 variant: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/2271
  - add markup to make optional
  
- Gary joined for last bit and we discussed the limitiations of regular expressions
  which is a standard, so we can't change it versus our XML schema. Anything within
  an <alt> tag is regex, and thus we don't have control over how it is implemented.
  This is especially relevant when it comes to white space and human readability of
  XML files for alternative text options. We could, however, look into better ways
  to convert/display the alternative text options. There is a thread on this in the
  spdx-legal email list
