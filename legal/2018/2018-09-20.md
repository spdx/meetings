## Agenda

1\) need to sort out emails that are not coming through unless approved
and approve faster and let people know to join list

  - discussed whether to remove moderation, but that would result in a
    lot of junk going to everyone, so not going to do that\!

2\) Update from LF Legal Summit (meeting under Chatham House Rule): one
workshop on compliance tools and general practice. A lot of general
dislike of existing tools (scanning and compliance) - areas for
improvement and interest in improvement. Support for SPDX as way to
communicate.

3\) Github issues:

  - <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/678> - Sendmail
