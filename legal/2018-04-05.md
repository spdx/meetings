## Agenda

1\) 3.1 release - went through all open PRs for 3.1 release and resolved
at <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML>. Tagged anything else for
3.2 or later release. Did same with issues. the 3.1 release will now
proceed: Gary will prepare the HTML pages for preview and then once that
we’ve had a chance to view that, it will then proceed to the official
release. This will probably happen over the next week.
