ACTION ITEM: Jilayne to update this on SPDX wiki page with preamble

## Review draft License List Match Guidelines (templatizing)

went through guideline document by section; change focus from
normalizing on guidelines - to just offering guidelines and let tools
makers implement

White Space

  - if one sentence moves to another paragraph, it would be treated the
    same; does this matter, can we find a use case where this would
    matter? could treat paragraph break as different than other
    whitespace breaks
  - seems okay to treat all white space the same; leave as is in
    guidelines

Capitalization - okay as is

Puncuation - okay as is

Bullets and Numbering

  - as to bullets/numbers, just say ignore these
  - this would require flagging this text within licenses that have
    references
  - can we ignore the bullet/number/letter, but not "lose" that info (so
    you still see it later), otherwise it would be unreadable - really
    internal details for tools anyway
  - can we just start here and see how it goes? Licenses that have
    internal references are less likely to have changes with numbering
    anyway
  - start here, and modify later if needed

Varietal Word Spelling

  - decision to re-word description re: British/American spelling to
    just equivalent spelling since geography is a non-issue
  - are there any words where there may be 3 different spelling? list
    only has two columns
      - Can't think of any example, but would be same - not
  - what about if a word is misspelled? - slippery slope to try and deal
    with this; if misspelled consistently in license, then will just
    match on misspelling;
      - Can watch to see if this comes up/examples

Copyright Symbol

  - okay as is - just say all three options are equivalent

Copyright notice

  - copyright notice line guideline: is the copyright notice at the top
    of BSD really part of the license?
  - License is something that should be fixed; where does license notice
    fall in this?
  - Copyright notice applies to file; but license is the actual text,
    not the notice (which may say you have to reproduce the copyright
    notice)
  - Should we then strip the copyright notice out altogether in our
    license list?
  - Copyright notice for license itself is distinct, so keep - but most
    cases it would not be part of license itself
  - How does this impact our license list - e.g. "GPL or later" where
    there isn't really an "or later" license, but is really just a
    notice
  - Then raises question of how to deal with preambles and epilogue?

â†’ next time pick up here with discussion and may tie into conversation
