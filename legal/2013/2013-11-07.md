## Agenda

**1) License Matching Guidelines (Jilayne)** - The SPDX License List
Matching Guidelines have been updated as per previous feedback, please
have a look here:
<http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines> for one last
proof read, as there were a couple changes that no one commented on.

  - brought up version numbering for license list - does it need to
    follow spec (in terms of 1.x and 2.x)? or can it follow it's own
    numbering? does it matter?
  - if own numbering, what constitutes a "major" release? (if doing own
    version numbering, if follow spec then don't have to define "major"
    release)
      - when we get the GPL-exceptions resolved
      - when we release all the templates for matching guidelines
  - maybe just follow spec numbering b/c license list will change
    incrementally
  - no set decision here, something to keep in mind for next release and
    can decide then

**2) "or later" and other license short identifier modifiers (Mark
Gisi)** - discussion has been going on via list; Mark in process of
scheduling a special meeting for this topic

  - Mark will send out a time for the meeting today, based on feedback
    from people who emailed him directly - will send to invite will go
    broad
  - as for a descriptive name: revisit current SPDX mechanism for
    describing license info using both the SPDX License List and the
    Boolean operators (via the spec, i.e., "and" and "or")
  - if you haven't responded to Mark re: your interest, please do; Phil
    will also circulate a plug via the general meeting minutes later
    today
  - discussion on this will begin with common examples and then discuss
    how to use SPDX to express them; goal to represent as much as
    possible of what's found without that syntax being too complicated
    or difficult
  - acknowledged practical implementation involves both SPDX License
    List and spec itself - need to work together effectively, but also
    need to keep in mind how to execute any changes
  - as for SPDX License List - this involves the "or later" issue (in
    particular for GNU license, but there are others that allow "or
    later" as well) and then how to best identify exceptions; current
    approach treats each license as a separate "line item" on SPDX-LL
      - in regards to exceptions - also have to consider matching
        guidelines - right now, matching on all of text of main license
        plus exception is probably not all that effective

**3) GPL exceptions (Tom V. & Mark Gisi)** - update on progress

  - Tom and Mark have conferred; Tom was to convert document to a Google
    drive doc, so everyone can access - he has a few more exceptions he
    found and then do that and share it
  - list is very comprehensive\!\!
  - will discuss for next call

**4) Fedora list (Zac)** - update, new licenses to cover, and some
discussion about short identifiers

  - for short identifiers - try to go with Fedora name, unless there's
    reason to change it
      - obvious scenario with "MIT" licenses - Fedora calls a lot of
        licenses MIT that will have a different name on SPDX License
        List
      - example, AMPAS BSD on Fedora, SPDX is calling AMPAS b/c thought
        it was confusing to use "BSD" as it's not really a BSD
  - discussion around rationale for adding to SPDX-LL - if it's on
    Fedora list, do we just add it to SPDX-LL full-stop or do we put
    some that are really rare or very one-off on a "waiting list" with
    idea that we can add it later and with idea that with limited
    resources, we are not going to add everything all at once. these
    licenses will be identified as "queued" in the Google doc - meaning
    we have no major objectino to add them, but they just seem so rare
    it is not a priority to add at this time
  - Aspell-ru License - agreed to add, but have issue of what it the
    entire license; Fedora has what appears to be "just" the license but
    Gentoo link Zac found has additional stuff at the top; this could be
    handled via a template to make such text "omitable" - going to put
    this on hold, as others like this may come up later and this way, we
    can ensure that such scenarios are all dealt with in a consistent
    manner
