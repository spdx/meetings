## Matching Guidelines joint discussion w/Legal and Tech teams

### Review Current Proposal

  - Review of the proposal on Github from Daniel German â€“ overview,
    explanation of proposal which uses double-curly brackets (a field)
    that include multiple attributes, e.g. a name for the item, type
    (e.g. options or required text), and an example; some (but only a
    few) regular expression language terms are used for this proposal
      - issue that this proposal it requires two files: one with the
        markup and one that is "plain" text for the license

### Comments, Feedback

  - Gary's proposal to add another field which is the text to be used in
    the standard text output
      - or could re-purpose "example" text in Daniel's proposal
      - could this attribute first in field, for readability; order of
        attributes does not matter
      - make new attribute called "original" which contains text that
        was there, it would be required, but can be empty and have that
        listed first in field
      - more work for anyone doing this to create a new example, so
        using examples already there - seems more efficient
  - we will need to document the fields and attributes and explain what
    it is, intention, and so forth - should that become part of the spec
    or an exhibit to the spec? - TBD, Kate not on call
  - regular expression is common enough that it will not limit
    tool-makers/innovation for scanning development
      - SPDX tools will be updated to generate the standard text from
        the template and also generate a highlighted webpage for the
        license - thus allowing the license list to be maintained with 1
        file per license (instead of two)
      - do people need to have a "plain" text files? can the templated
        text file be enough (i.e. idea of just having ONE file
        maintained and everything created from that? yes
      - can we take templates to GitHub (yes, we need to do this anyway)

<!-- end list -->

  - what needs to have markup?
      - no question that we need markup for text that is within the
        license or additional exhibits that do not need to be included
        for the license to be a match
      - what about titles - is the guideline enough or do we need
        markup? discussed, decided to not markup titles as a rule and
        decide further as we go along
      - what about copyright notices (and issue that some copyright
        notices are for the license itself and some are for the code)?
        should be marked up

## Process for Implementation

  - getting into process - what is the variability that we need to
    implement in current licenses? how to communicate that?
  - regular expression language probably too complicated to have legal
    team take-on. Daniel offered to do this part, but will need guidance
    from legal team as to what is variable
  - use text files and put {{ }} around
  - start with most common or problematic licenses first; track what has
    been reviewed by legal team
  - Gary and Daniel to sort out details for repository for getting files
    to Daniel, storing, access. etc - on GitHub or some such repository
    that we can all easily access
