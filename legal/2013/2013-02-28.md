License List Matching Guidlines

  - have no owner, so no progress since last year
  - Collab Summit allows ability to have cross-team inclusion; also a
    topic that better lends itself
  - probably need a couple hours for this (if longer, will need a break)
  - → Jack will schedule for right after lunch
  - → Jack and Kirsten to reach out to tech team in terms of inclusion
  - → Jilayne to reach out to Daniel German, Matt Germanprez, and
    someone from Fossology to ask them to be come
  - → Jilayne to draft a description/announcement for legal team, that
    can be pasted/used for other teams

## Licenses to add to SPDX-LL

any feedback for Kirsten's proposal for tracking? → proposal sounds
good, she will begin building new page for tracking

  - Affero 1.0 - see <http://www.affero.org/oagpl.html> → ADD TO
    SPDX-LL, should have all versions, missed this one in first rounds
  - MITRE Collaborative Virtual Workspace License (OSI approved, but not
    on SPDX-LL, see email from Tom Incorvia) → ADD TO SPDX-LL, should
    have all OSI approved licenses, even old ones
  - Reciprocal Public License v1.1 (OSI approved, but not on SPDX-LL,
    see email from Tom Incorvia) → ADD TO SPDX-LL, should have all OSI
    approved licenses, even old ones
  - [Free Software
    License](http://www.dipp.nrw.de/d-fsl/index_html/lizenzen/en/D-FSL-1_0_en.txt%7CGerman):
    see email from Till Jaeger) → question of whether this license is
    "used in the wild," site doesn't list any software available that
    uses it. is English language search going to find uses anyway? Till
    included note that it is created and backed by German state; seems
    to meet the OSI criteria → ADD TO SPDX-LL
  - these licenses will be given two weeks (until next meeting) for any
    objection by greater legal mailing list, then considered added to
    the SPDX-LL; they will appear on the actual license list after the
    next revision (probably end of March or early April)

## License Inclusion Guidelines

discuss latest revision; see email and attachment sent by Tom Vidal
yesterday

  - Tom V. provided a bit of background from last meeting to
    remind/inform anyone on call this week who missed; some feedback
    already provided via email
  - if a license does meet all the OSI criteria (even if not OSI
    approved) - then would it be added? would it matter if not "commonly
    used" or would that weigh in as part of the criteria or do we just
    add automatically? discussion
  - decided: if yes (meets OSI definition), then approve; if no, but it
    is close, then look at "is it commonly used" or by a commonly used
    project or any other such usage factors (e.g. approved by German
    state)
  - → Tom V. to make revisions based on discussion and email and
    circulate to group

## generic "public domain" short identifier

page added to explain discussion that has occurred several times
regarding the idea of having a generic "public domain" short identifier.
see
[Legal\_Team/Decisions/Dealing\_with\_Public\_Domain\_within\_SPDX\_Files\_(DRAFT)](Legal_Team/Decisions/Dealing_with_Public_Domain_within_SPDX_Files_\(DRAFT\) "wikilink")

  - maybe more explicit info on "how to handle public domain" (also add
    to any documentation/how-to documents)
  - → everyone to review and send any feedback, word-smithing, etc. to
    Jilayne
