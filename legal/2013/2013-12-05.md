## Agenda

1\) what on the plate?

  - Fedora List and CC v4 licenses to add - Dennis to update table
  - GPL exceptions and Mark's modifiers - seems like this will be on
    hold until January
  - call schedule:
      - call on 19th a go and will only do Fedora list on that call -
        Zac to update Google Drive doc to assign more licenses to review
        for that call
      - no call on Jan 2nd and will pick up for 2014 on Jan 16

2\) Creative Commons v4 licenses - request to add to SPDX License List

  - there are 6 in the family; CC0 was not updated, but may be updated
    in 2014, so something to watch for
  - no one on call had had a chance to look at new licenses yet, will
    probably add, but want to do full diligence and make sure we have
    reviewed - pick up on call on 19th

3\) update on exception modifiers for License List (and special meeting)
from Mark G.

  - has created wiki page on SPDX site to describe the scenario,
    description of problem, and use cases (and include link to Tom's GPL
    exceptions)
  - Mark will send link to limited people first for feedback and then
    send for general feedback;
  - hope to have more people look at it and think about it before call,
    which will be scheduled sometime in January - findings will be
    recorded on this page and then recommendations from call made to
    Tech and Legal teams
  - (more discussion related to this and GPL exceptions as well below)

4\) GPL Exceptions list update (Tom V. w/help from Mark G.)

  - process overview from Tom: started searching for exceptions with
    intention to capture "everything." found that there are many, many,
    many...
      - list is as exhaustive as it could be, but could probably find
        more b/c lots of tool developers have created new ones to use
        with their tools
      - has not done comparison among text to see if some are similar
        text with just different names
  - Mark and Tom discussed that because there is such proliferation that
    maybe SPDX-LL goal shouldn't be capturing all exceptions, but to
    indicate with a symbol whether there is an exception (without
    specific list)
      - for example, "with" would be the operator and then capture
        actual text in License Ref --\> this is more of a solution. this
        could be more pragmatic in terms of review process - people know
        GPLv2, but probably don't "know" the exceptions, so having the
        text for the exception alone in a LicenseRef field makes it
        easier to review that bit in particular
      - more thought on how to capture within spec - LicenseRef or a new
        field in spec?
      - would we need a new part of the list to list the exceptions for
        the very common ones which would capture the text of the
        exception? possible issue of having short identifiers for
        exceptions is that unlike licenses that usually have a steward,
        exceptions don't necessarily have this. then there is issue of
        some exceptions applying to various versions of licenses and
        some being version specific
  - balance of keeping value of list via consistency and accuracy with
    thoroughness; should license list be "pure" licenses - as in
    well-defined things? exceptions are not well-defined things
  - for now, just trying to capture list of exceptions
  - need to also address specific situation with GPL-3.0 allowing extra
    terms

5\) Fedora list - go through next set of licenses - Zac -- ran out of
time, will pick up on this on the 19th

## Tasks for next call

1.  give Mark feedback on new wiki page
2.  look over Creative Commons version 4 licenses
3.  review next set of Fedora licenses (see green highlighting)
