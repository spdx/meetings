## Agenda

All agreed three people is not enough to make any major decisions.

All agreed that Creative Commons version 4 licenses should be added to
list.

Next rev of SPDX License List slated for January, although there may be
issues to discuss by the legal team (on the next call) before publishing
it.

In regard to the CC v4 licenses, we need to discuss the template for
license matching purposes. Specifically, should the three paragraphs
(two at the top and one at the bottom) in the light gray boxes be
considered part of the license for matching purposes? Likewise, in the
older versions, there is a similar paragraph at the beginning and end.
see: <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode>, also
see: <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode>

  - the last paragraph states that it is not part of the license
  - the second paragraph in the new versions seems to be akin to a
    preamble
  - the first paragraph (in new and old) is more of a disclaimer
    specific to CC for providing the licenses

Is the inclusion of any or all of these parts required to make it a
positive match for the license? Conversely, if these bits were not
included would it still be a match?
