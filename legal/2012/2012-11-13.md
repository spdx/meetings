## Attendees

  - Jilayne Lovejoy, OpenLogic
  - Tom Incorvia, Micro Focus
  - Paul Madick, HP
  - Tom Vidal

## couple quick updates

  - distributed draft of guildelines for types of licenses to be
    included (or not included on License List). Tom Vidal drafted first
    round with Tom Incorvia and Jilayne reviewing.
  - responded to Roger Meier re: Flora license request
  - have not responded to Roger's suggestion re: moving License List to
    Git (Jilayne to address this)

## Discussion re: draft license guidelines

  - focusing on list of characteristics: Vidal explained how he came up
    with factors - not a set of six, but more like a list of
    possibilities, how does a license rank on these factors (may not
    necessarily be mandatory)
      - "provides access to source code" is probably right, but example,
        re: requiring distribution of source code is not always the
        case. maybe change language in lead-in to explain this, maybe
        even use IRS analogy
      - maybe change to description of broad grant of rights; source
        code accessible.
      - discussion on how to capture "direct license" concept as factor
      - (see edits in document - included below with track changes from
        today's call.)
      - Tom V. to take edits and provide another revision for next call
