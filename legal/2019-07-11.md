## Agenda

1\) Joint tech/legal team calls:

  - Given the increase in cross-functional tech team/legal team topics
    coming up, it was suggested on the general call was right before
    legal call to have a standing joint tech & legal team call at a
    regular interval. This would avoid having to schedule something
    separate
  - Since the tech team already meets every week, it was decided to do
    this for the third Tuesday tech team call every month. Dial info and
    time here: <https://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team>
  - Recurring invite will be sent to the legal team
  - If issues in tech call that legal team might not be aware of, tag in
    spec as “legal team review” and discuss in joint call

2\) “SPDX-Copyright:” tag – suggestion from REUSE folks and discussion
in Github issue here: <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/122>

  - REUSE requested it in SPDX because SPDX is a specification (whereas
    they are producing guidance documentation). If this was added to the
    SPDX specification, it would be in the form of an appendix, which
    would explain the use-case and parameters, similar to how the
    SPDX-LicenseIdentifier has its own appendix (see:
    <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/master/chapters/appendix-V-using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files.md>
    )

highlights of discussion on call:

  - must make sure it’s not perceived as SPDX giving legal advice in the
    sense of recommending use of a copyright notice when most Berne
    jurisdictions don’t require it - the challenges of tooling being
    able to do this accurately has long been a known difficulty.
  - goal of having this is if people are going to use a copyright, it
    provides a tag that makes finding the copyright notice easier/helps
    tooling (and extract, if needed for license compliance)
  - consider two sides of colon in the tag - the name of the tag to the
    left of the colon and what goes on the left side of the colon. SPDX
    should not recommend or prescribe any format for the right side of
    the colon
  - Discussed possible name of tag for left side: discussed various
    options and pros and cons, but key point that came to some consensus
    was that if this is tied to spec, it should be consistent with what
    is used in the spec. In this case, section 4.8 of the spec defines
    the field for copyright text and uses “FileCopyrightText:” for the
    SPDX tag value, so would make sense to be consistent, see:
    <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/master/chapters/4-file-information.md#48-copyright-text->
      - People have asked about using other fields from SPDX spec in
        source files, so if we defined a way to do so, then would answer
        that question and give people a path if they found other SPDX
        specification fields useful to be used in this way or elsewhere,
        perhaps in one appendix
      - noted that SPDX-License-Identifier: remains as an outlier b/c
        doesn’t map to corresponding tag, nature of the use and how it
        evolved, so it will be its own appendix
      - pros and cons of “SPDX” being part of the tag - could be
        confusing (it's not the copyright for SPDX...) but also queues
        as to where it is defined; will need to be clear on description
        in appendix
      - Looking at e.g. “SPDX-FileCopyrightText:” - maps on SPDX field,
        uses "SPDX" to queue relationship and definition in spec

3\) SPDX-License-Identifier: should it be confined to only one line?
(not delineated either way currently)

  - can possible have more than one line/tag if files are combined, so
    probably not good to constrain this
  - this led to comment about when more than one license, but don't know
    if it's "and" or "or" - issue raised already for using semicolon as
    operator to indicate unknown relationship (another topic to discuss
    on joint call with tech/legal team)

4\) Collaboration with OSI: Jilayne and Pam Chestek had a good chat and
identified some items that need to be fixed/updated to align SPDX and
OSI licenses, issues logged in SPDX where applicable and Jilayne sent
email to OSI board with summary and suggestions. Aim to work on areas of
potential collaboration going forward.
