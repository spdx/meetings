## Agenda

1\) dial-in info is going to change as per the next meeting; the invite
will be updated as well as the info on the landing wiki page

2\) 2.0 update: spec release not until LinuxCon Europe, so going to push
new version of License List with new licenses (but not 2.0 items).
Update on 2.0 initiatives in any case as follows:

  - license expression syntax - Mark has been working on this and gotten
    some initial feedback; Tom to still look through spec to flag areas
    to pay attention to - needs to get a current-ish version of spec;
    will send to legal team on both counts soon (next week or so)
  - license exception list - Dennis has updated spreadsheet; we've
    identified list of exceptions for 2.0, then have bunch of exception
    candidates for future releases; Dennis also added information for
    defining columns in a README sheet in Google doc; now that we have a
    bit more time, should we include more exceptions that originally
    planned? (had decided for first release with new structure to only
    have existing exceptions)
  - rendering on website - in terms of where exception list is stored
    and
  - license matching templates - moving along, coordinating with Daniel
    for markup

3\) new version of SPDX License List - going to do a release soon with
all the new licenses and then release again with 2.0 of the spec

  - a couple new licenses from requests:
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/License_List/Licenses_Under_Consideration>
    - need to decide on short identifiers and whether a template is
    needed (Dennis to add columns for tracking this info going forward)
  - Caldera License - Caldera - no template/markup needed
  - bzip2 - had lengthy discussion here after determining that the link
    we had from the request states it's version 1.0.5 but the 1.0.6
    (current) download includes a license with the last sentence
    regarding patents omitted. Decided to add both as two distinct
    licenses and contact developer as it also appears that prior
    versions might be different - to get further information about other
    versions (and hope that such minor changes are not made, or if made,
    tracked more transparently)
  - still need to resolve similar issues with Ruby License (ran out of
    time for this, so will summarize via email)
  - also will need another set of eyes to "double check" Jilayne's work
    since this is a big add (who can do this very detail-oriented work?)
