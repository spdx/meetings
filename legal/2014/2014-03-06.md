## Agenda

**1) new license requests**: Microsoft Patterns & Practices License
(MSPPL)

  - by adding, could open slippery slope to other similar
    "commercial-ish" licenses; we also have no way of knowing if MS
    changes is, how reliable is this license in this regard
  - view that this is not even the most common MS license; folks on call
    had not seen it all "in the wild"
  - issue that we have no way of knowing if MS changes it and uses same
    name (same as Sun/Oracle license issue), in which case better to
    capture it as a LicenseRef in SPDX spec as one-off license
  - decision to not accept, Dennis to update License Request page and
    let Oliver know since he wasn't able to join the call this time

**2) Fedora list** - went through items that still had questions and
flagged a few things to ask Fedora about.

  - for MIT variants; will ask Tom Calloway re: differentiation in
    language for those listed; then on next call look at all of them at
    one time (re-sort Google doc list to make it easier)
  - ACTION ITEM FOR ALL: add your comments to the list for anything that
    is green or white\!
