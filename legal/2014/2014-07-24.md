## Agenda

1\) The next release of the license list is coming together and almost
ready\! We will discuss any outstanding issues (below) and also seek
some volunteers for helping review the list before publishing.

  - have not heard back from Fedora folks on outstanding questions there
    ...
  - missing "+" or later variations for AGPL, GDL ... - not going add
    now because will be deprecated in next license list release
  - zlib license issue: We have zlib License on the SPDX License List
    (http://www.zlib.net/zlib\_license.html), which is OSI approved and
    on Fedora list (all the same license text and short identifier).
    However, OSI and Fedora call this "zlib/libpng License" - do we care
    that the full license names don't line up? especially consider that
    there is also a separate libpng license -
    <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/src/libpng-LICENSE.txt> (which we
    have on SPDX-LL as libpng License (libpng)?
      - we have it more accurately represented in regards to the full
        license name, the short identifiers are aligned (most
        importantly) - so no need to change, but maybe just point this
        out to Fedora and OSI for their information.

<!-- end list -->

  - need help reviewing for accuracy/second set of eyeballs before next
    release: Dennis volunteered to help; Jilayne will send him the .zip
    to review before official release (to look over in next week)

<!-- end list -->

  - matching guidelines and re-formatting - could use some help on this
    task generally: Paul may be able to help; will connect next week on
    details

2\) Getting back on track for 2.0

  - update and discuss roadmap going forward on next call to get back on
    track for 2.0 tasks - namely, License Expression Syntax (Mark) and
    further review of License Exception List (Dennis)
  - standard headers issue: when we deprecate the + licenses (becuase
    will be represented with new license expression syntax "+" modifier)
    - we will lose the "or later version" text in corresponding standard
    headers (for GNU licenses) - what to do about this?
      - does anyone depend on the standard header field? could we get
        rid of it? maybe throw this out on the legal list and tech list
        and see what people have to say
      - it is a benefit to include the standard header as it gives
        something else (besides the entire text of the license) to
        search/identify the license on
      - various discussion about this field and (standard) headers
        generally
      - \--\> put out statement that we are thinking about removing this
        field and why - if someone has a reason for not removing, to say
        why and how to resolve)
      - Jilayne to draft such email, have Paul, Dennis, Mark review and
        then send to tech and legal mailing lists
