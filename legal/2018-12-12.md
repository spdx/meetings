## Agenda

1\) Contributing updates and license submission tool:

  - license submission tool - 3 more issues that need to be addressed;
    need someone who knows Python in Django framework; Bradley offered
    to help after Dec 20th-ish; if anyone picks up an issue, just make
    sure to assign yourself, so people know you are working on it (first
    come, first serve\!)
  - 3 issues have to do with updating or adding fields:
      - <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues/64> for
        updating a Comments field (this is most urgent)
      - <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues/66> for
        updates to OSI approved or submitted question
      - <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues/65> for adding
        field regarding license author or steward
  - Jilayne to ensure we have a note in CONTRIBUTING as to where to log
    issues on tool - <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues>

2\) 3.4 release outstanding issues: comments added and issues and PR
closed or merged in repo for 3.4 release, as well as a bit of clean-up
of old stuff

  - note: for license submissions where submitter has become
    unresponsive, we added a label for that and informally will give
    people at least a full release cycle to respond

3\) Alan’s new tool for determining if license text is on SPDX License
List via diff mechanism\!\!

  - is in his repo in source and Chrome extension where you can take
    text and diff it against SPDX License List; ranks matches based on
    amount of differences -
    <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spdx-diff/kfoadicmilbgnicoldjmccpaicejacdh>
  - also can be used with Firefox, but not published there yet
  - exceptions are not in tool yet
  - Steve will talk to Kate about getting extension over to an LF
    account
  - source code is currently here:
    <https://github.com/alandtse/spdx-diff>
  - need to think about name because we have “diff” tool for diff’ing
    SPDX documents - put your vote for name in the issues in Github,
    Alan gets to decide since he wrote
