## Agenda

1. License namespaces - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/681

Didn't get to the other topics:

2. SPDX-License-Identifier and snippets - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/464
3. (if time is available) Adding NONE to the License Expression syntax: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/49

## Notes

### License namespaces (first half hour) - @zvr list for discussion:
1. Use case
  * only in source code files
  * in SPDX Documents
2. Format
  * dot-dash (domain)
  * dash-dash (organization)
  * nothing special(?) (as scancode already does)
3. License publishing -- where is the SPDX document
  * in SPDX project
  * outside SPDX project
  * not even a document(?) (scancode?)
4. Registration process
  * what checks will be done before "accepting"
5. Registration publishing -- how the registered names will be published
  * list on GitHub
  * releases/versions?

Staring point: what is the original goal of this and problem this is solving:
* Mark Atwood: Discussed usage of license namespaces internally at Amazon
  * Currently using this dash-dot formatted LicenseRef to tag files, but without a corresponding SPDX Document defining the license identifier
* summary of goal:
  * Semi-stable way to refer a specific license text with a license identifier for use in SPDX Documents and anywhere else a license identifier may be used.
* tech team call: should be defined in DocumentRef- the same as other external document refs
  * Already in v2.2 can refer to license outside SPDX Document using DocumentRef-[some identifier]:LicenseRef-[licenseid] to external document and another section in SPDX Document that tells you info about that external document
  * would use same registration, but for a DocumentRef not LicenseRef-

* Question from Gary: Is the Legal Team on board with implementing license namespaces at all, if the perfect syntax were found?
  * Not sure can answer this yet, other things to determine before keying in on implementation
  * Steve - Personally interested, but need to identify specific problem(s) and solutions
* Joint calls tech + legal are appropriate
* Perhaps next week's tech team call?
* Jilayne to prepare a Google Doc with initial thoughts / proposal
