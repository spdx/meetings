## Notes

### Introductions

New people!

* Ria - New OSPO Program Manager at HPE. A lawyer who's moved to the biz side. Happy to be here!  https://www.linkedin.com/in/riaschalnat/
* Jacob - At Synopsys, focusing more on compliance stuff in 2022. Also happy to be here! So much happiness abounds!

Introductory links:

* [License list](https://spdx.org/licenses/)
* [Our Github repo](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML)
* [The inclusion principles](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/DOCS/license-inclusion-principles.md)
  * Biggest area folks can help is reviewing new license requests alongside the inclusion principles, and chiming in on the license request [issue thread](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues)

Ria suggested that SPDX/Linux Foundation could be an organisation for pro-bono legal work. Jilayne hasn't heard that suggestion before and is very keen. Discussion of pro-bono requirements for lawyers in the USA, which varies by state (in terms of recording requirements - e.g., CO and MA - not recorded, but in WA could be counted towards CLE)
* Steve can get in contact with Linux Foundation legal team about whether this is a possibility.
* or could it meet any corporate requirements

### Reviewing open issues for 3.16

### [#1349](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1349)

Is source available, not open source, but based on inclusion principles appears to bear inclusion to the list. It's not FOSS but likely to be included in an SBOM so an identifier is useful.

Asking submitter or Elastic to prep the files, but if they can't then we'll need to do this before the 3.16 release.

### [#1366](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1366)

Sebastian will handle this and word the 'no' in a constructive manner

### [#1367](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1367)

Waiting for the license steward to confirm some things.

### [#1368](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1368)

JL has some research to do, so it's on hold.

### [#1369](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1369)

SW doesn't think it's urgent and can get bumped if needed.

### [#1385](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1385)

Could use some testing.

Context: Giving some more support for people who aren't as familiar with git.

### [#1383](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1383)

Uh... there's no license text. Will check with the license stewards for more information, and if they don't get back to us we'll close this out.

...and then they closed it during the call. Yay, one fewer thing to worry about!

### [#1393](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1393)

We've already included v2.1.

Ran the 3.0 text through the [license list diff tool Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spdx-license-diff/kfoadicmilbgnicoldjmccpaicejacdh?hl=en) (there's also an [extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/spdx-license-diff/)) and it seems the extension may be having an issue right now? The tool seems to get confused by text files.

## Combined LGPL+GPL discussion

[The email thread](https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/search?p=recentpostdate%2Fsticky%2C%2C%2C20%2C2%2C0%2C0&q=lgpl) and [the summary email](https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/message/2975?p=%2C%2C%2C20%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A%3Arecentpostdate%2Fsticky%2C%2Clgpl%2C20%2C2%2C0%2C84501245)

Matija: FSF started offering a concatenated version that includes LGPL & GPL in the same file. REUSE thinks this is OK, but not sure about SPDX.
But written advice remains same - two files, COPYING (with GPL) and COPYING.LESSER (with LGPL_

Sebastian with context: Found an old thread on REUSE about LGPLv3 that said it makes it hard to do compliance because LGPL requires GPL and this causes some false positives.

So the combined license document exists now. Sebastian suggests we include that GPL copy as an optional block in the LGPL license XML.

JL: FSF put the [document on the site](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl+gpl-3.0.txt) but it's hard to find. Plus their suggested guidance hasn't changed.

REUSE is pulling the license text from the [text version in the license list data repo](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/master/text). Max manually adds these in, so there's human oversight.

Steve is probably generally in favour of adding it as an optional block but needs to re-review the thread to confirm. Matija is obviously in favour as well ;)

Will pick up the conversation on the mailing list. Steve will revive that.

## Future topics

* Earmarked for next meeting (Jan. 20): Follow-up discussion: think about how to speed faster review/addition for simple licenses in use in Fedora
* follow-up on pro bono / CLE credit idea
