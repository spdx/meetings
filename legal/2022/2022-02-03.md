## Notes

### Online tools - minor changes
* John interested in helping
  * some question about which parts are Python vs. using Java SPDX tools
  * will reach out to Gary and Rohit (reply to Jilayne's email on list)
* updates to be made:
  * Moving "Comments" field up to top of form (already merged, we'll see change in next release, which should be soon - see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/pull/302
  * additional changes (need to check with Gary as to whether would be included in pending release?) see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues/336
    * Adding "Unknown" option to OSI status drop-down menu
    * Add popup to "license steward" explaining "unknown" as option, or even parenthetical in explanation text
    * Remove "email address" field, just use GitHub ID / issue thread for discussion

### Changing meeting cadence
* Folks interested in going to 2nd and 4th Thursdays rather than every other week
* Will switch to 10th for next meeting, assuming no objections on list

### Related: getting more done in between meetings
* Vicky (not attending today) previously mentioned idea of quarterly get-together, similar to "hackfest" -- everyone doing their own work, but at the same time and availability to discuss topics
* Another idea: send to mailing list a consistent email every Monday listing issues that need to be looked at
  * Steve liked both ideas; hackfest idea being quarterly seems like a good cadence (e.g., monthly would be too often). weekly emails also has been helpful when we've done that
  * reminder of guideline that if 3 approvals of pending license - then can call is approved (avoids need to discuss on calls)
* is there room for greater use of Github Actions? - think through how that works and some things that we could add to remove some manual work
  * example: /approve - as a code and if written 3 times, auto-approve it or something like that (if not too much work to create)

### Pro bono / CLE credit
* Probably not formal credit, but Steve can send an informal note describing where someone has participated in meetings / contributions to the project
* People can leverage e.g. their company volunteer days to participate
* Historically, SPDX legal team has tried to take the position of "we're not giving legal advice"

### Issues List
* 905: postpone discussion; Jilayne has already figured out some of those details; move to 3.17
* 1387: deprecate bzip 1.05 license - add something in the notes saying 1.06 is the version to be used going forward; Steve will pick this up and get it in for 3.16
* 1389: X11 license which is essentially the MIT license with a note at the bottom against advetising. Original request was to make the text at the bottom (which specifies X Consortium) replaceable so other companies could use the license as well - this was agreed to on the meeting.
  - Someone noticed that there is a substantive difference: "distribute or distribute with modifications," - is this enough - yes, this alteration would be a separate license
  - Would be interesting to write an article explaining the difference between our own "personal" interpretations of whether two licenses are the same, vs. SPDX purposes of treating of two arguably-substantively-different licenses as separate -- perhaps for JOLTS or Linux.com - maybe Paul can start and us the X11 as an example. Take the guiding principles and give them more context.
* Jilayne walks through the basics of adding a license to the SPDX List
- Steve dropped in the link to a template for submission: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/DOCS/submission-response-template.md
- Vicky's write up of how new licenses get added: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/DOCS/new-license-workflow.md
