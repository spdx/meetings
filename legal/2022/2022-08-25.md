## Agenda

* Fedora license request submissions
* Review license submission tool
* Sync on documentation update work

## Notes

* Fedora license request submissions
  * Richard: generally lower-importance licenses -- not critical ones for refocusing Fedora on SPDX identifiers
  * submissions from other Fedora package maintainers are higher priority / importance
  * open re: process for Fedora to determine whether SPDX has made a decision regarding acceptance or a short identifier
  * Jilayne: consider more clear statement re: status and availability of license IDs after acceptance, but prior to next quarterly release being published - others have asked this in the past and we have informally answered that they should feel fine using id after PR merged, but prior to actual release
  * but should/could that be when license is accepted
  * Fedora's desire to have the "lag" be as short as possible => may go ahead and e.g. add a TOML file after acceptance
  * Sebastian: should we also consider if we need releases?
  * this is tied to SPDX doc that has field for version of SPDX License List
  * worth discussing this on the mailing list

* Review license submission tool
  * https://tools.spdx.org/app/submit_new_license/
  * open questions to discuss listed here: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1572 - went through fields from top:
 * who can make updates: uses Django, need some knowledge, but don't have to be an expert -  "getting started" for DJango that will give you a high level overview of the framework used by the SPDX online tools:
https://www.djangoproject.com/start/; Here's a pointer to the Django Views and Templates - key to any UI work on the SPDX online tools:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/overview/#write-your-views; Link to where you can find the templates in the Online tools:

 * note that tooltips are not actual bullets which might be problematic for accessability - remove pop-up and have hard-coded on the page. Put text under header in not-bold
   * first field: Comments vs. License Inclusion Principles text box
    - originally was just "Comments", too broad / non-specific
    - now refers to "explain why meets the license inclusion principles", though tooltip doesn't reference that
    - outcome: remove old tooltip, change to "Briefly explain..."
  * full name field: tooltip language is kind of too much and outdated
    - Richard: most FOSS licenses don't have name; suggests to submitter that they should invent a name
    - whether or not something is suggested or left blank, legal team needs to evaluate and revise / propose something that seems reasonable to what people might see, not be misleading, etc.
    - outcome: change heading to say "Full name of license (if applicable)"; in tooltip say "Enter any known or specified title, if there is one. If not, you may suggest one or leave blank"
    - also might help to add a bullet in Fields desription about how we come up with full name https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-fields.md
  * short identifier: tooltip repeats field "guidance"
    - outcome: change header to "Suggest short identifier"
    - outcome: tooltip, remove first and bottom two, add where applicable
  * source / url: tooltip too long
   - outcome: change header to "URL to license text"; edit tooltip to something like, official URl, if there is one, or to project to uses it
  * OSI status: remove this entirely?
    - OSI may have had a different philosophical view re: approving / documentation of licenses
    - if we had more automation / collaboration with OSI, this wouldn't be necessary
    - it is helpful if license has been submitted and is pending, b/c then we know to wait for OSI to finish process (as license text can change during that)
 * license author or steward:
    - Add tooltip re: what does "license steward" mean -- e.g. "person or organization who maintains current and new versions of the license" or something similar
 * note: we already decided to remove email address field some time ago: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues/367


## Future topics

* continue online tools submission starting at OSI Status
    - "URLs" for example projects should be generalized to listing informion on projects where the license can be found. This question seems to assume that someone can find the license easily using a web interface to a source repository, but there are actually many widely-found licenses for which that is not true.
