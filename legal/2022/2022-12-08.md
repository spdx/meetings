### 3.20 open issues
* https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+license%2Fexception+request%22
* currently ~40 requests, mostly from Fedora (especially from Richard); queuing up while focusing on documentation for 3.19
* Jilayne added new label for "needs files made"; also note tag for linked PRs

### process for license review
* Jilayne asked two questions to group:
* for those who don't feel comfortable doing an initial review of licenses - does it make it easier to "review" as second reviewer?
  * Sebastian says yes
* we have policy of needing at least 3 SPDX approvers (2 lawyers and 1 non-lawyer), see https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/request-new-license.md
  * could change to 2 people, if it's already met Fedora or Debian license criteria and exists in that distro
  * change to "at least one lawyer"
  * could we use Kanban boards type situation: submitted but not reviewed, reviewed but not accepted, accepted but no files/PR made
