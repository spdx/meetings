## Notes

* updates to the SPDX License Submission online tool; PR from Jilayne / Gary help with testing
  - https://tools.spdx.org/app/submit_new_license/
  - Jilayne has PR at made changes to revise / remove hover-overs and related language - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/pull/387
  - Noted that SPDX online tools include online XML editor, and going to license request => can shift request into XML editor; Jilayne and Gary are working on fixing bug in pushing this
  - Note that PR only adds the XML file, not the test text file => in short term, suggest adding notice above the "Confirm" button to let people know they need to add it

* FAQs - plan for getting all the new changes into a PR + formatting item from Jilayne
  - had been copied over into shared Google Drive: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VhqW3WgG0T2rDdPP-7lx9VbLVU3RAykOy9ZjZOS664I/edit
  - Jilayne noted that GitHub auto-generates a Table of Contents for MarkDown files (button in upper left above file view)
  - Might remove questions from top? But consider readability - may be hard to read the questions in just the little click-down menu (maybe make sure questions are more concise?)
  - Prior discussion / suggestions in issue: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1439
  - Jilayne to update clean google doc; others to review early next week before release

* Steve's PR re: Add documentation on XML templates and fields at https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/pull/1677
  - Warner and John made a bunch of helpful comments, which Steve has mostly responded to
  - seems ready to go and then iterate once it's merged, easier to read that way
  - also need to add to list on DOCS/README => Steve completed

* review of remaining open documentation issues for 3.19
  - comments in issue threads

## Future topics

* Steve to look into and re-send invites -- Mary noted incorrect language after meeting invite link with stray </p characters, resulting in invalid link
* consider team discussion re: custom exceptions - change proposal at https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/blob/main/proposals/ExceptionRef.md, comments at https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/4
