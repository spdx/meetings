## Agenda

* quick update on Fedora and SPDX identifiers
* Final reviews / PRs for upcoming 3.18 release

## Notes
* SPDX 2.3  release - matching guidelines have been updated!!! https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/761
* #1523 - joint legal/tech formalizing license list XML format - e.g. documentation of tags
  * Steve will suggest one of the next couple legal team calls for the joint discussion
* Documentation: something to look at in the near future would be the annex for license expressions - nothing has changed since it was drafted, but it might use some improvements to be easier to read/ human accessible
  * raises issue of what belongs in spec (annex) v. documentation outside spec (then question: webpage or new DOCS repo??) - would be good to have documentation inclusion principles, e.g., guidance as to what should go where. maybe even could turn that into a blurb on website that informs people of where to go for various types of info
  * beneficial to have stuff in .md format for eventual reality of moving website to be generated from Github, which Sebastian has been working on
  * "how to contribute" instructions are part of same place/process (e.g., website)
  * consider a follow-up conversation or documentation working group focused on documentation improvements => suggest raising to Steering Committee
* idea for next "release" of spdx-legal team, to pause on licensing and focus on documentation improvements?
  * have response to new issues/licenses in repo that explains this and tag for next release
  * might be good to collate of list of all things license list "documentation", e.g., FAQ updates, license list publisher doc improvements

* Fedora and SPDX identifiers
  * "in process", stay tuned
  * Lots of time spent on improving Fedora licensing documentation
  * Prior mailing list discussion: Should SPDX IDs cover the entirety of a distro's packages' licenses?
    * likely means explosion of licenses to be added, especially old permissive variants (likely an unknown number)
  * Specific thing: Recurring request for public domain tag
    * Something like 350 packages in Fedora that use Fedora's short name "Public Domain", with no idea what the text is
    * Hesitancy to have all these variants submitted for the specific text used to say "this is dedicated to the public domain"
    * Would we have a single identifier to match to multiple texts? something to discuss potentially in future, but food for thought in the meantime, could be slippery slope, does it matter... etc. Conversation should be cross-community
    * Sebastian: should they just use LicenseRef-'s? could do, but still issue of one-to-one representation, v. one-to-many (that are defined)
    * Vicky: have seen this come up in practice, seeing value in finding a way to have a coherent approach to this

## Future topics
* Public Domain tagging - implementation and considerations
