## Notes

### Matching Guidelines update
* old issue was open - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/905
* current version still references pre-XML license list structure
* also was moved into an appendix the spec, as well as on the website
* numbering is off b/c had to change headings / sub-headings for ISO in 2.2.1
* goal for update:
  1. update in spec appendix for SPDX 2.3
  2. take the website page down, and just point to the spec
* Jilayne started a Google doc that we looked at on a prior meeting - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bNj0vTd-L5gsLUtS0z0QoOl4xP3DwJS_mQnCMl9VFz0/edit#heading=h.euzp7gzbhoh3
* Next steps - Jilayne tagged Gary in the doc, will sort out a few things re: changes; will submit a PR in spdx-spec, mostly non-substantive, mostly mirroring with XML tags

* #1432 / #1517 - MS-LPL - need to validate, CI checks didn't run for some reason

* #1403 - rename master to main - Steve to look at, may do before or after 3.18 release, just need to make sure workflow files are updated too and nothing breaks

* #1512 - OTP-SESY - Steve to respond and confirm whether this is actually a real license, or a copy-and-replace version of https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/SRD-OGL_V1.1.pdf
