## Notes

* Matching Guidelines update - Jilayne is working on update in a Google doc for prelimnary discussion which will then be moved to an actual PR (and then take web page down so we don't have them in two places!)
  * for guidelines that are NOT implemented via an XML tag - came up with a standard way to express that
  * for guidelines that do have an XML tag, came up with a standard way to express that and decided to put any "hints" on using them when making an XML file at the bottom section of the matching guidelines, along with other tags that may not map to a guideline
  * add link to XML tag schema
  * keep section on legacy markup (with explanation) - and later task to circle back on formal adoption of XML markup beyond just for license list original files

* Snippet in source file update from Gary - see: https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/tech-2022-06-07/tech/2022-06-07.md#snippets-in-source-file
  * discussed on last Tech Team call a couple days ago
  * for implementation, discussion on Tuesday landed on: SPDX-SnippetBegin SPDX-SnippetEnd
  * would be added to Annex H SPDX File Tag - no change to actual spec
* update on "namespace" discussion - had a special call last Friday and follow-up tomorrow at 8am Pacific time
  * key to consider for any proposal as how the proposal ties or fits in with the SPDX mission/vision - this should always be a startint point!
  * need to clarify one of the problem statements b/c it was a bit conflated
  * meeting minutes from last week's call at https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/180/files
  * OpenChain tooling group was discussing concept of license repository - capability discussion - https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/Sharing-creates-value/tree/master/Tooling-Landscape/CapabilityMap

* StandardLicenseHeader - Jilayne noticed some files that don't have one still have tag, sometimes with "none" in between beginning/end tag.
  * Gary confirmed that we should simply not use if if not needed and having "none" could show up elsewhere where we don't want/need that
  * Jilayne to check on how these are displaying on website, then make a PR on a few examples and tag Gary to check on license-list-data

* Open Source Summit in Austin week of June 19th - some SPDXers may be meeting up; probably not enough for quorum, but watch for more info if you are going or not going and want to try to join via a dial-in (if the room used to meet-up allows)
