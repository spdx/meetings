## Agenda

1\) 3.2 release

  - went through outstanding PRs for 3.2 release; updated milestones and
    assigned a few new licenses that need PR made with XML and .txt
    files created
  - Google patent grant - has 3 variations, Steve has captured in PR,
    but might be worth discussing for next release and reaching out to
    Google. Mostly used in Go language with BSD-3-Clause
  - Recognized need to do better about how to define stuff that is
    included on “exception” part of license list - some other language
    more descriptive than "exception" might be better; all agree the
    clear feature of all of these things (like Google patent) is that
    they augment an existing license, live with the code (like a
    license) and apply across the project (like a license), but are not
    a license in and of themselves. To discuss more and ideas for
    changing name of that part of list, further improvements to
    description there in future (this was also identified as something
    to improve at the F2F meeting in March)

2\) stale URL & case sensitive discussion (updated to SPDX License List
collateral/website pages)

  - discussed, and reviewed various comments in issues - as per
    consensus from all that, will add to Overview page the following
    bullet in the description of the URL field:
      - "Note that the source URL may refer to an original URL for the
        license which is no longer active. We don't remove inactive
        URLs. New or best available URLs may be added."
