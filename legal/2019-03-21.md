## Agenda

1\) go through outstanding issues for 3.5 release and update:

  - two licenses that had some aspect of being non-commercial were
    submitted, CC license seems to be blessed but there is a warning the
    comments by Mike L on the many ported CC licenses (e.g. where do we
    draw line? It would be helpful to have some input from CC on what
    they consider to be canonical licenses)
  - this also touched upon bigger issues of adding more licenses
    generally and how strict on open source should we be? This, in turn,
    then touches upon the issue of having only a handful of volunteers
    who do actual work (most notably, generating the XML files, PRs,
    comments on issues, etc.) of adding a license. If we decided to be
    more lenient on what goes on list, the amount of work is not
    scalable (it's not even really do-able now)
      - Currently, it takes probably about half hour to an hour to do
        one license
      - We can improve tooling to some degree, but will always need
        human review.
      - Suggestion to change process such that \* SPDX legal team makes
        decision, but actually building of files to submit has to be
        done by submitter or other community members interested in
        having license on list; this way more people have to be involved
  - other note on XML markup: where copyright notice and names are in
    text and replaceable - can have either specific or generic as the
    text that appears / exemplar text b/c doesn’t matter for matching
    purposes
  - submit issues for online tooling for GSoC students: Gary and team
    are asking them to work on small issues as part selection process,
    so helpful to have smaller things to point them to
  - various issues for 3.5 assigned and plan for who is going to see
    which issues/PRs to end. Aim to have all tied up by next Friday, Mar
    29 then do actual release on April 1
