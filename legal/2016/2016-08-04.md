## Agenda

  - new license request: from Tom Incorvia for Net-SNMP license:
      - this is actually a composite of multiple licenses which appear
        to be all BSD-3-Clause and one instance of MIT-CMU
      - Alan did comparison to be sure on BSD-3-Clause - only one
        difference in Sun license that has statement of trademark
        ownership and other text at beginning. Not substantive from a
        compliance perspective but we would normally make this a new
        license. Discussed possibility of options with new markup
        capabilities on this kind of thing, as well as “needs legal
        discussion” flags on BSD-2-Clause-NetBSD and
        BSD-2-Clause-FreeBSD — decided this could be a feature request
        later, but for now, stick to our normal way of operating.
      - Can identify Net-SNMP with license expression of: BSD-3-Clause
        AND MIT-CMU AND LicenseRef-\<\> now. or can add new license for
        Sun variation and use that instead of LicenseRef- - will email
        Tom I for further thoughts

<!-- end list -->

  - BSD-Source-Code is missing some markup in one spot where there is a
    name - needs to be added to master file as per Sam’s email - Sam to
    add to XML file

<!-- end list -->

  - BSD-2-Clause example that uses "expressed" instead of "express" in
    first line of disclaimer section - lawyers on call agreed to legal
    difference. also found an instance of this in BSD-3-Clause
      - address with specific markup - Kris or Sam will add to XML files

<!-- end list -->

  - **NOTE tasks for getting XML conversion done and timeline from last
    call: <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Minutes/2016-07-21>
    \!\!\!**

Next call is Aug 18, then Sept 1 - so we may schedule an additional call
the week of Aug 22nd if need be

Kris' advice on XML review: don't get caught up in flexibility of new
tooling (XML format, etc.) - keep same/conservative approach as always,
unless you find something that is plain wrong/we missed before
