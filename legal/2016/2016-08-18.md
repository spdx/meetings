## Agenda

1\) Went through all items in Github repo that were tagged "needs legal
discussion" or "question", etc.

  - discussed meaning of <optional> tag in terms of when to use it and
    what guidelines we use to make this call. Matching Guidelines 2.1.4
    is starting point, explaining the omitable text means text marked as
    such can be considered a match if hte text indicated is present and
    matches OR the text indicated is missing altogether. Matching
    Guidelines 12 talks about extraneous text at the end of a license
    which may be omitable. This kind of text was not marked up in, so
    whether to use the optional tag now came up in a few licenses. We
    discussed the reality that just making a call as to whether the text
    is part of the license or not is a legal interpretation, but that
    sometimes it is clearly not part of the license and where it is
    questionalbe, then we will likely err on the side of caution and not
    mark it as optional.

2\) Review timeline and to-do tasks (see:
<http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Minutes/2016-07-21>). Decided not
to schedule another call next week. Hope to stay on track, get some work
done via mailing list in next two weeks.
