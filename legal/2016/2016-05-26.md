## Agenda

1\) Normal business/updates:

  - license request that doesn’t really appear to be a license, but nice
    to know about. Dennis will reply
  - Choose-a-license - SPDX License List reference added to the about
    page, see <https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/pull/416>
    and live version here: <http://choosealicense.com/about/>

3\) XML license list review update:

  - it’s going well, let’s keep up the momentum\!\! approximately 141
    done and 173 to go\! (plus the license exceptions)
  - “needs legal review” label - many of these are relatively minor and
    probably relate to the optional tag getting added where it need not
    be. all on call agreed that if have 3 lawyers agree with the
    assessment in a comment in Github, then can merge and no need to
    discuss on a call. Let’s try to clear such items out by next call,
    so only ones that need discussing remain
  - Kris created a tool to be able to view the XML files to see what it
    looks like: <http://krisreeves.com/xmledit>
      - workflow using this tool: cut and paste XML into the tool to be
        able to see what it looks like, edit XML as needed, then paste
        back to Github
  - if you notice issues with nesting list tags: either fix it, if you
    feel comfortable doing so; otherwise label as bug with a comment as
    to what the issue is you are seeing; if everything else is fine,
    then also label as “approved” so Kris will know it’s otherwise good
    to go once code issue is fixed
  - license exceptions also need to be done in XML format, will follow
    same format as licenses, probably in a separate directory (same
    structure on back-end as now)
  - deprecated licenses also need to be dealt with…
      - if we have license content and run matching stuff should get
        current identifiers (don’t want to get deprecated identifier),
        thus don’t need template for deprecated files. what we need is
        to know when someone uses a deprecated identifier, that it means
        Y in the new identifiers/license expression. could put this in a
        manifest with list of deprecated licenses and what the new
        identifier equivalent is
  - we won't realistically get this all done for end of June release,
    but will plan for Q3 license list release at end of September. Other
    things to do for such prep:
      - get exceptions into XML and review as well
      - make list of deprecate license equivalency
      - check tooling update for conversions to various formats (Gary
        has already worked on updating tool to create web pages)
      - move master for license list to be kept on Github (instead of on
        LF git repo and mirrored to Github). Also need to create
        workflow for what this will look like - Gary did a first draft
        of this, but needs to be updated - someone to volunteer to do
        this update by June 23 call so we can discuss then
