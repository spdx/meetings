## Agenda

1\) review of to-do items for 2.5 release and what's "on hold'

  - we have 3 new licenses for 2.5
  - Jilayne to follow-up w/Mike L and requestor re: open Gov't license
    (how many are there?) so we can move off "on hold" status
  - javascript sortable table - send to Kris to see if he can fix for
    next release
  - add sortable option to exceptions

2\) XML review

  - we seem to have stalled a bit on review; many of longer licenses are
    left, people busy
  - Kris reiterated don't have to fix XML (like Sam has been doing, yeah
    Sam\!), but need legal review at the high-level
  - discussed optional tag showing up at start of licenses which was not
    marked up originally. Original guidelines was that we didn't mark up
    stuff that we didn't think people omitted in practice, no need to
    markup. Some things were marked as optional in this pass that we
    didn't have as optional before. Guiding principle for this pass:
    stick with same guiding principle, have a think again, and remove
    (new) optional tags as needed
  - looked at some of the XML files with "help wanted" whilst on call
    and cleared a few issues
  - next call: overview of rest of work that needs to be done for this
    to be ready for Q3 release
