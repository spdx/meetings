## Agenda

**1) New license requests:** Considering it is already March, we will
begin with the two new license requests, to be sure they can be resolved
and added for the Q1 release at the end of the month. Please see:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11AKxLBoN_VXM32OmDTk2hKeYExKzsnPjAVM7rLstQ8s/edit?pli=1#gid=695212681>

  - Free Art License 1.3 - approved for 2.4, but need to resolve
    different language/versions question
      - discussed challenge of licenses with different translations and
        matching - should we have different translations of a license as
        separate licenses or just the "canonical" language and then
        other translations would be treated as a match? what if the
        license steward doesn't identify the canonical language?
      - current status on license list regarding licenses that have
        non-English translations (that we know of):
          - CECILL licenses are included as separate licenses, which
            reflects how they are presented by license steward
          - EUPL is listed in English with link (in Notes field) to list
            of other translations; EUPL-1.1 has clause stating that "All
            linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the
            European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take
            advantage of the linguistic version of their choice." --\>
            Thus, treating translations as equivalent seems like the
            right choice (although we currently don't have a mechanism
            for matching to this end)
          - D-FSL-1.0 is listed in German with link to English
            translation. The license includes a clause (in English)
            stating: "This License is written in German and English.
            Both versions are equally binding. It is assumed that
            terminology used in the License has the same meaning in both
            versions. Should, however, differences arise, such meaning
            is authoritative which best brings into line both versions,
            taking into consideration the aim and purpose of the
            License." --\> Thus, also in this case, treating
            translations as equivalent seems like the right choice
            (although we currently don't have a mechanism for matching
            to this end)
      - more discussion of which way this license should go: Dennis'
        French language skills leads him to believe they are different
        licenses and we should add all versions as separate items,
        perhaps using essentially same identifier with a language
        differentiator at the end of the identifier
      - worst case scenario could/would be if different licenses taken
        to court in different languages could be interpreted to have
        different meanings - this would also cut towards having 7
        different licenses; Court would have to honor clause in license
        that defined prevailing interpretation v. if it just said this
        on website, we don't know if judge would honor that in the same
        way as if it was drafted that way. on other hand, courts can
        come up with different interpretations of same license in same
        language anyway\!
      - ACTION ITEM: Jilayne to reach out to license authors to ask
        their thoughts and post comment on Github thread to this end

<!-- end list -->

  - BSD-3-Clause minus clause 2?
      - discussed where used, what (possible) goal of license to avoid
        attribution requirements for binary distributions, which has
        been a topic in various places
      - looks like license is used by one entity (named in license) -
        small sofware consultancy, but on multiple projects; given above
        possible goal, could see more use
      - discussed possible name and short identifier as: BSD Source Code
        Attribution - BSD-Source-Code (license author just refers to it
        as "BSD License" - no good for SPDX)
      - ACTION ITEM: Paul to reach out to license author (who was not
        the one to ask license to be added to SPDX) that we want to add
        it, but wanted to let him know of the proposed full name and
        identifier

<!-- end list -->

  - As a result of discussions and resulting action items for these two
    licenses, determined that anytime a request to add a license comes
    from someone other than the license author (to the extent we can
    tell this), might be worth reaching out to license author as
    courtesy if nothing else (and to avoid 0BSD / OSI type scenario from
    occurring) - added to license tracking Google worksheet as a
    reminder item in our review
      - to discuss: consider adding item for when requesting a new
        license to ask: Are you the license author? If no, can you
        identify the license author? - or something along those lines

2\) Collab Summit update:

  - SPDX all day Wednesday, OpenChain Thursday morning; FOSSology
    Thursday afternoon
  - update on whoâ€™s going or not able to:
      - going: Kate, Jilayne, Paul, Phil, Kris,Mark
      - maybe: Alan, Eric
      - no: Dennis, Brad, Kyle

3\) XML license templates project: Kris has done a second pass - see his
previous email, updated wiki page here:
<http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Templatizing/tags-matching>, and
actual source of files here:
<https://github.com/myndzi/license-list/tree/xml-test/src>

  - come up with practical plan for reviewing license and possible need
    for scheduling of additional meetings
  - cut and paste using something like Komodo for easier viewing
  - Jilayne to setup different call w/Kris and Gary for purpose of
    discussing details of formatting, conversion to HTML pages, etc.
