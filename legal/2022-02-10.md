## Notes

* Mary's introduction: Is at Qualcomm as an open source attorney, as well as in the patent division. Is using SPDX License Identifiers and introducing collegues at Qualcomm to SPDX.

* FOSDEM:
  - Sebastian - gave a talk at FOSDEM in the security track - https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/security_sbom/ (recording is not up yet - Sebastian can send to people or wait for FOSDEM to post)
  - Ria mentioned a good talk on sustaining communties (not SBOM or SPDX related, but more general) https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/community_contributions/
  - Good one on Community:  https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/community_contributions/

* mention of issue re: changing "master" to "main" for name of branch
  - easy to rename, but will break URLs - can create another branch, called Main and have Master track for that for transition
  - maybe also raise on mailing list (both tech and legal list)

* Discussed Prosperity-3.0 license request. Submitter asked for 3.0 but gave license text of version 2. Jilayne asked for clarification but there was no response. Decided to only consider 3.0 for this meeting. After discussion, decided to decline due to lack of substantial use and unclear drafting in some sections.

* other licenses to review in email sent a couple days ago - comment or +1 if agree so we can move those along without meeting discussion time
  - if submitter is SPDX-legal team, then "rule of three" for acceptance should not include submitter
