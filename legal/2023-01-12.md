## Agenda and Notes

### Change Proposal: https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/4

* text at: https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/blob/main/proposals/ExceptionRef.md
* Not currently talking about: changing definition of excpetions for the SPDX Exceptions List
* Question 1: In Annex D.4.4, currently says: use LicenseRef to represent entire custom license + exception. Should that be changed to allow "ExceptionRef" (or another name) as custom exceptions?
  - Stated differently: Should it be possible to have something custom (that is not on the SPDX License List-exceptions list) on the right side of a `WITH` expression
  - Consensus that it should be possible to have something custom on the right side of the `WITH`
* Question 2: If 1 is yes, what form should it take?
* ExceptionRef or re-use/extent LicenseRef or ModifierRef or Something else?
  - Part of drafting this involves understanding whether this is limited to strict exceptions as defined by SPDX License List, or any sort of "modifier"
  - For purposes of the SPDX Exceptions List, only text where the "exceptions" are additional permissions (not restrictions) are accepted on the exceptions list -- so `WITH` has been be presumed to align with that in termss of adding permissions, not imposing restrictions
  - For custom "modifiers", would break that assumption, but not change what is allowed on exceptions list (unless someone wants to submit a different change proposal to change that)

* Undecided about whether this would use "ExceptionRef-", "LicenseRef-" or something else
* Undecided about whether it would allow custom things that are not "exceptions"
* Alexios and Philippe each to prepare PRs with specifics of what this would look like, aiming for sometime after FOSDEM (mid-February) - Feb 9th call
