## Agenda

**1) Discuss 2014 priorities**

  - Robust discussion regarding the various priorities the legal team
    intends to tackle in calendar year 2014.
  - The list of priorities can be found at
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Current_Projects_and_Issues> .
  - The group agreed that the license expression review is a high
    priority and might benefit from at least one meeting prior to the
    Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit in March. Tom Vidal
    volunteered to check with Mark Gisi to see if scheduling such a
    meeting was possible.

**2) New business**

Phil joined the OSI discussion list in order to participate in OSI's
discussion regarding machine readable versions of OSI licenses. If
anyone else is interested in joining the discussion list ask Phil.
