## Agenda

**1) License expression syntax**

  - Mark has not gotten any further feedback, so feeling like it's
    pretty close
  - Mark raised issue of whether SPDX License List short identifiers and
    (new) license expression operators should be case sensitive with the
    Tech Team and discussed further here: decided that for purposes of
    spec, in terms of a legitimate value, both could be case insensitive
    (but best practice would be to display with precise capitalization).
    Mark to go back to tech team with this decision.
  - Mark is also working on accompanying FAQ document for the license
    expression syntax. He has identified 7 questions/areas to answer,
    which we discussed. those are (roughly):

<!-- end list -->

1.  why do we need license expression language? (aren't open source
    projects under a single license?)
2.  what is the difference between a license and a license notice?
3.  do we have examples?
4.  why is GPL-2.0+ no longer an identifier in SPDX 2.0?
5.  why are some expressions no longer valid?
6.  what is the difference between a license and a license expression?
7.  is the license expression case sensitive?

<!-- end list -->

  - Mark to send first draft of FAQ document to legal team for review at
    next meeting, Oct 2
