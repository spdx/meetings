## Agenda

1\) discussion of “license exceptions” description and particular
requests for additions - see
<https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/message/2445> for some background

  - discussed Linux kernel enforcement statement
    - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/655 and GPL
    Cooperation Commitment
    - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/714
      - By putting kernel enforcement statement on SPDX list helps to
        shows that it’s out there and enables use via identifier.
        Acknowledged that enforcement statement is copyright
        holder-specific, but it's people might do vetting and figure out
        what files the enforcement statement applies to across the board
        (where all copyright holders have signed enforcement statement).
        At this point, there are big chunks of code that could be under
        license with kernel enforcement statement, so may not be so hard
        to determine that. As more kernel copyright holders sign-up,
        this will get easier, so good to have identifier for that
        eventuality
      - question as to if kernel enforcement statement "changes" the
        license or just about how certain copyright holders enforce the
        license?
          - it’s an additional permission, it uses contractual language;
            then GPL Cooperation Commitment follows with more explicit
            language
          - problem with "change" is can be interpreted as changing the
            entire license or changing an aspect (modifying, excepting,
            augmenting, additional permission) but not changing the
            over-arching license. Exceptions - as on SPDX License List
            thus far - are the latter. Description does state that these
            things are not stand alone licenses.
  - Regarding GPL CC: drafted for projects to be used by new projects or
    existing projects where adoption of commitment can be done for apply
    as of date
      - question as to whether language for corporate and individual
        versions are similar enough to project version that we can
        accommodate with matching markup and use one identifier. This
        needs to be investigated as part of implementation.
          - Richard to help provide diff; Alexios to help with SPDX
            markup potential, so all can then review/discuss
  - implementation of adding kernel enforcement statement question: how
    to handle list of names (not part of statement?); and
    preamble/information part at start?
      - probably best to do markup as straw man, then discuss on Github
        issue as to specifics

2\) discussion on potential changes to existing explanation for License
Exceptions on <https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html>

  - Jilayne had proposed changing from "exceptions" to "modifiers", but
    all on call agreed we didn't actually have to edit this language
    now; as it stands, the kernel enforcement statement and GPL
    Cooperation Commitment fit the description
  - exceptions or "modifiers" are things that could have legal impact on
    original/over-arching license
  - we might want to add a point that any exception needs to fit the
    license inclusion principles just as licenses do; so long as any
    additional term doesn't take a license out of the open source
    definition, then could still include it
  - Google patent grant may stretch this definition a bit and no one
    from Google on call, so tabled discussion on that issue
