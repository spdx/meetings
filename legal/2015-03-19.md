## Agenda

1\) Went over the following updated pages made changes or revisions as
needed.

  - <http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/license-list-overview>
  - <http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines>
  - <http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/request-new-license-or-exception>

2\) updates to the pending SPDX License List, v2.0 (as per discussion on
last call: <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Minutes/2015-03-05> -
<http://spdx.org/licenses/preview/>

  - everyone liked the new table formatting (we are at least in the 90's
    style era now)
  - working on creating sortable columns as well
  - add link to License Expression Syntax and to Exceptions in paragraph
    about deprecated licenses

3\) OSI approved a new license (and we missed it) -
<http://opensource.org/licenses/UPL>

  - will add, no template needed, short identifier = UPL-1.0
  - need to communicate with OSI re: making sure we know when they add a
    new license and we should discuss short identifier before publishing
    so to ensure we don't end up with duplicate short identifiers, etc.

4\) Github research and License API - did everyone see this:
<https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com>

  - also, discussion with Github, OSI, and SPDX re: SPDX LIcense List
    and leveraging, tying into that work :) stay tuned.
