## Minutes

Comments on specific issues are contained in the particular GitHub issue
threads at <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues>

Discussion focused on prep for the upcoming 3.7 release.

Discussed GPL family of licenses re: proxies / later versions. May have
been previously discussed re: operator in connection with
-only/-or-later issue. If need to add an operator, won’t be in the next
week as it would need to be in the spec; not really a standalone license
list matter.

Could re-open the conversation - would be a good mailing list
conversation – John will search the archives to check and email list by
meeting after next (e.g. in next 4 weeks)

Different languages in licenses: issue to be opened Jilayne and Kate
presentation from 2017: Wiki:

MirOS: comments are already optional – ask Gary why they aren't showing
as blue optional text in the published list. Is this new version used in
the wild? The noted text is already optional, but can’t rewrite the
license now -- matching guidelines should be raised in the issue.

May want to add to documentation re: we strongly try to avoid changing
license IDs for existing entries.
