## Minutes

The group continued to drive on the below key issues:

1.  The "licensing/legal terms/disclaimer" for the SPDX meta-data;
2.  Method to revise SPDX metadata, including the option of using a
    changelog; and
3.  Confidentiality-state of SPDX metadata.

For \#3 above, the group concluded that both a mandatory "radio-button"
style confidentiality feature should be included in the specification,
with an optional open text field for additional text, if needed.

For \#2, the group began discussing the [Data Commons
PDDL 1.0](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/%7COpen), and
other alternative approaches. Creative Commons was re-visited and
explained that CC is problematic if the author/creator can be anonymous
as previously agreed.
