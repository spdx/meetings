## Minutes

At Kate's suggestion, in revised Section 5.3, the following changes were
agreed:

1.  change "License Information in File" TAG VALUE from "License
    Information:" to "LicenseInfoInFile:"; and
2.  normalize "Standard and Non-Standard License Information" across all
    Section 5.3 fields.

Other minor suggested revisions to the Section 5.3 "field names" were
discussed, but then withdrawn.
