## Discussion on "Modified MIT/CC-0/PDDL"

with populating Mark Gisi's spreadsheet and reminder from Karen on "why
we initially avoided CC-0"

<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>

<http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/>

  - Karen circulated a modified MIT license with comments as an option
  - issues came up at Vancouver birds of a feather discussion re:
    hesitation about using a new/unfamiliar license (PddL)
  - Mark Gisi maintaining a tracking document with pros and cons re:
    various license options so can see how we came to the final decision
  - Why not CC-Zero?
      - Karen had raised concern by merely using CC-Zero might indicate
        there is copyright protection in data or an
        endorsement/agreement with European data laws o maybe we can
        diffuse this concern with some introductory language? E.g. "to
        the extent there are any rights… (description of rights)…"
      - will it imply that we believe data is copyrightable and that
        could create other repercussions?
      - CC-Zero does cover European laws, no gap in coverage; maybe
        makes more sense to present a legal tool around this, instead of
        debating; if take position of someone who receives the database
        and don't give them a license (to avoid) then they may have to
        assume they have to get © clearence, so as practical matter,
        better to give license up front
          - Preface license with statement that comments and anything
            else that may be copyrightable according to local law -
            CC-Zero (or whatever) applies
          - i.e. "I'm not sure what's all in there, but whatever it is,
            I'm giving it to you under public domain"
      - o would CC-Zero appease the feedback at the Vancouver birds of a
        feather
          - more brand recognition for CC, so people more familiar with
            products by them
          - CC-Zero is shorter than PDDL is longer and not used as
            commonly, thus making CC-Zero more palatable even if PDDL
            does the same thing
          - Maybe good to go to various foundation and community guys at
            BOF and ask if this would work

**Action:** Rockett, Karen, Adam, Jordan, Kim → to prepare the preamble
and get that to legal group for review in a week, then Kim can bring
this to foundation/community people to get feedback (or buy-in); with
goal of closing on this issue by two weeks/next legal meeting

## Discuss "Confidentiality" treatments

  - Re: CC-Zero allowing confidentiality provisions without conflict?
  - 3 states:
      - no confidentiality at all
      - confidential for a certain period of time
      - confidential
      - issue more about SPDX trademark; ex. Motorola will use SPDX
        throughout, but if can't keep it confidential, then will still
        use it, but just won't call it "SPDX"
  - strong reaction against tying trademark to this; engineers had
    negative reaction
      - concern was around ability to make changes and contribute it
        back and still be SPDX (mostly)
          - need to give people a proscribed way to add fields,
            customize it, address extensibility - if we gave some
            explicit way to do this, might it alleviate some of these
            concerns?
          - Always said we'd deal with extensibility with next version
            of spec
      - maybe raise confidentiality separately than compliance/trademark
        issue o working on technical proposal to separate… ??
  - putting aside how marking of file is done, how about an open-ended
    field to site confidentiality?
      - Open-ended description/option seems fine to allow vendors to
        mark as needed
  - Adam to get more feedback on what exactly was the concern around
    this

## Discuss finishing license "templatizing"

  - how do you know that two license texts that look the same are
    actually the same; Kate had sent link summarizing where we were on
    this thus far.
      - Normalizing to case and spacing; no swapping paragraphs; no
        changing punctuation; replacement of "copyright holder" or
        "author" fields, etc.
      - Rockett, Jilayne, Kate - to dust that list off, make sure it
        makes sense and distribute to group for review and comment by
        rest of group
