## Minutes

Agenda:

1.  review handful of quick licenses
2.  LGPL-3.0 question - license vs. exception
3.  inclusion guidelines

For the licenses that were discussed, comments on specific issues are
contained in the particular GitHub issue threads at
<https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues>

LGPL-3.0 discussion – have tried to be sensitive to prevailing views in
the community. Really try not to change identifiers – have deprecated
some (re: e.g. -or-later / -only) – should be only changed if there’s a
very, very strong reason to do so. Consensus on the call was that
community views of the LGPL-3.0 tend to treat it as its own license,
rather than as an exception.

For the inclusion guidelines, discussion continued of the draft update
from Jilayne at PR 985. Changes and open issues were discussed regarding
the interim draft.
