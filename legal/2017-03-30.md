## Agenda

1\) Brad’s ABA presentation: 20-25 people, including range of
people/companies

  - add Brad’s presentation (as well as Jilayne’s from OSLS -
    <https://spdx.org/library> - and others
  - why is this page called “library”), ask Jack, also re: news items
    for these things
  - some questions Brad got: concerns about representing proprietary
    licenses alongside open source licenses in a package; question about
    other formats for compliance reports (everyone wants a different
    one, that’s why we have SPDX)

2\) Update on XML

  - ask Gary about deprecated licenses - is he going to do these?
  - new tag for exceptions (instead of license tag) - added to Google
    doc
