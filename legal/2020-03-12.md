## Minutes

Reviewed update to license inclusion principles in PR 985

Discussed inclusion of references to “binary-only” exclusion re:
software vs. media content and data; revised language to clarify meaning
of exclusion, also to add language to clarify that this isn’t about the
files under the license, but about the license itself.

Suggest including a side FAQ doc that can evolve over time, for
clarifications that don’t require fully reopening the principles. For
e.g. drive-by submissions, can then point people to the docs
specifically and then be able to close the issue.

Discussed wording of next-to-last bullet point on “source available”
licenses

Discussed adding Definition of Free Cultural Works to list of baseline
definitions

Participants will continue commenting on open issues. Anything new
coming in won’t get into 3.9, which will likely be delayed by a month to
accommodate new additions under the updated inclusion principles after
they go live.

W3C licenses – only a few are currently on the list, but more are in
real-world use. Matija will locate actually-used W3C licenses and start
submitting issues to add them.
