## Agenda

1\. Feedback regarding SPDX v2.0: Mark Gisi provided an update including
the need for language to describe parentheticals for the tools. Will be
discussed at technical meetings.

2\. New license/exceptions requests

Approved the spencer license, need to decide on names for license and
whether other versions should be included.

3\. Disjunctive license notices: See examples, such as
<http://dev.perl.org/licenses/> or
<https://netbeans.org/about/legal/license.html> : Discussed additional
information provided with some licenses. This can be revisited, but the
current thinking is to use new syntax to address disjunctive licenses
(or license refs)

4\. Conjunctive (composite) licenses on license list. Should we break
apart or leave as is? : Discussed. No conclusion.

5\. Recommended headers for licenses that donâ€™t have a standard header
(Mark Gisi).: Discussed. Currently we do not think SPDX can provide a
list of non-standard headers.
