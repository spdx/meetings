## Agenda

**1) Fedora License List**

  - We added many of the Fedora licenses to the SPDX list
  - Fedora is continuing to add licenses to its list and we have not
    been capturing that information
  - Paul Madick will monitor the Fedora site and bring any new additions
    back to the group for consideration
  - At some point we will need to reconcile the SPDX and Fedora list to
    ascertain what licenses were added to Fedora's good license list
    from the time we originally scraped the list until Paul Madick began
    monitoring the site

**2) License Expression**

  - Mark Gisi is preparing a FAQ for the license expression document.
    Will send to the Legal Team for comment.
  - We have had some questions raised by email regarding if the
    specification is case sensitive (UPPER/lower)
  - Discussed preference to maintain no explicit rule on case
    (UPPER/lower), except perhaps in the license expression operators in
    output.
  - Mark Gisi will discuss the Legal Teams preference with the Tech
    Team.

**3) Next Meeting** --\> Review License Expression Syntax and related
FAQ
