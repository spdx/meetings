## Agenda

**1) License List templatizing proposal**: update/review from Kris on
state of proposal and look at first pass output and looked at an example
in light of meeting minutes from joint call - notes here:
<http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/Minutes/2016-02-09> (starting
point for info on this proposal is here:
<http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Templatizing> )

  - discussion around
    <body>
    tag and what that should (or should not) include / nesting of tags:
      - comment that
        <body>
        tag doesn't include optional tags such as
        <title>
        or <copyright>
      - but
        <body>
        tag as is would allow to have variations on license, e.g.,
        licenses that have different language translations that are
        considered equivalent; Sam has mapped translations to same
        identifier (for EUPL, and maybe CC licenses) - will need to
        discuss how to handle such situations as its own discussion
      - standard header uses a tag, which is missing in this pass; might
        be better to have it there with nothing in tag. header tag
        should not be included in tag that wraps the entire license
      - use of
        <body>
        tag for text of actual license alone is helpful if you want to
        automate reproducing just the license text
      - tagging bullets to illustrate where they can be disregarded;
        could not mark some numbering if want to have those matching
      - also discussed whether we would want to differentiate
        sub-sections within license text - value here could be in terms
        of compliance to reference specific sections and allowing
        traceability where compliance is not 100%, could identify where
        compliant
  - list of equivalent words would still apply, but not illustrated in
    these files; those would be included in another iteration of the
    license file that is more computer-friendly. These master files are
    for denoting things humans are good to identify that computers are
    not good at identifying
  - matching guidelines may change from, "you don't have to match
    bullets" to "you don't have to match on anything in this tag"
  - note, these XML files are master files from which other iterations
    (e.g., HTML pages, plain text, etc.) are generated from
  - decision point re: what to call tags and how to nest them and map
    this to current matching guidelines with beginning of revisions for
    matching guidelines - this is starting point; then Kris can revise
    and make "official" first pass for all files; then review by legal
    team
      - better to not map on RDF since really not related; tags should
        relate to matching guidelines so should map there.
      - discussed need to have "pair-programming" approach to review

**Action items for next call**:

  - Kris to do write-up on wiki of tag names and relation to matching
    guidelines; group will review on next call, March 3rd (wiki page
    here:
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/Templatizing/tags-matching> )
  - Also need to address how to deal with license exceptions (and
    deprecated licenses)

**2) update on Collab Summit schedule**

  - who will be there: Jilayne, Paul, Kris, Phil - maybe, Eric and Sam -
    probably not
  - Info can be found here:
    <http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit>
  - SPDX will have a room for work group all day on Wednesday: morning
    for review of 2.1 spec and afternoon for license templatizing work -
    would be great to have as many people as possible there\!
