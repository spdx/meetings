## Agenda

1\) Bradâ€™s presentation to ABA, IP Law section, subcommittee on computer
programs and new technology

  - he had done a presentation to the open source subcommittee
    previously, but not much activity, only a few people; this
    subcommittee is more active

2\) XML update:

  - exceptions : example of use field - decided to collapse into Notes
    or URL fields as appropriate, since most exceptions don't even have
    anything in this field, so not worth creating a new field
  - copyright notice for license itself (e.g. GPL, Apache-2.0) - should
    not be in copyright tag, just matchable text. Need to remove
    copyright tag on these. will also need to update guideline 10:
    Except where the copyright notice covers the actual text of the
    license.
  - aim for next release to be the XML conversion (even if not exactly
    at end of March/end of quarter), keep reassessing progress on each
    call
  - discussion re: will xml release be 3.0 or 2.7? major change, but is
    it really that different to end-user? but then will be on different
    major version from spec.. need to get more input here

3\) Other business:

  - add Bootloader exception (see spreadsheet)
  - sleepy cat email from Philippe - just sent before meeting - discuss
    on next call
