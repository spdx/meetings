* Jilayne subsequently updated docs at https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/request-new-license.md -- high-level overview of request / review / addition process, with links to more details
* Jilayne to add link to video from Steve's demo, will re-record for Jilayne's version (given changes to online tools)
