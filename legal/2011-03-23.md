## Minutes

  - The group re-reported that the SPDX Tools License is concluded to be
    Apache 2.0. Further, the SPDX team will recommend that any 3rd party
    desiring to open source SPDX tools, also license such 3rd party
    tools under the Apache 2.0 license. No objections.
  - Kate confirmed that revised section 5.3 was being placed into the
    SPDX Beta Specification.
  - Discussions began on "whether there is a need for the
    Author/Creator" field.
  - A changelog approach to revisions of SPDX metadata was initially
    suggested by Kate. Tom and others substantially added.
  - The "Confidentiality Statement/Field" was discussed, and generally
    agreed, but no specific implementation(s) was been concluded.
  - Update on the "Templatizing" effort was given. See
    <http://spdx.org/wiki/guidelines-templatizing-licenses>
  - It was suggested that we provide a public facing site of all known
    SPDX tools, when such tools are available.
