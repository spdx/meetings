## Agenda

1\) Update on GSoC - maybe next call have Gary update us on which
projects are going forward and what relates to SPDX License List or
relevant tools

2\) Revising the Overview page and other DOCS

  - Moved field descriptions to markdown page in Github DOCS directory.
    Also removed references to this in CONTRIBUTING as the fields
    definitions are now in pop-ups in the SPDX license submission online
    tool.
      - agreed to add links to FSF free page and OSI-approved page in
        Fields description
      - reminder to submit issue to also update to tool pop-ups for
        links (or any changes) so they are same
      - add is FSF free? question to license submission tool as well
  - license inclusion principles part of overview page also moved to
    markdown page in Github DOCS
      - need to add link to open data definition and FSF 4 freedoms
      - may also want to add a note that any license approved by the
        orgs listed would be appropriate for inclusion on SPDX License
        List
      - re-write background principles and include comment about past
        decisions and usefulness of SPDX License list (mark’s point from
        last call) - but move to end. maybe include here some examples
        of "exceptions"
      - consider adding list of negative factors - things we would not
        put on based on examples of past rejections

<!-- end list -->

  - Overview page currently has 3 parts: definition at top (used on
    other pages as well); license inclusion principles; fields: license
    inclusion principles and fields now on own md page in Github - what
    about the ‘what is the SPDX License List’ part? Jilayne made a stab
    at a re-write, which could also be part of web "redesign" - for now,
    putting in separate Github page for review, see:
    <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/jlovejoy-inclusion-1/DOCS/what-why-how.md>
      - all on call thought this was good
      - if this was to be used at top of license list main page, need to
        ask Gary about whether license list tool can pull text from
        Github repo

<!-- end list -->

  - what to do with Overview HTML page and planning?
      - get info pulled into Github, and some amount of review, then
        reduce overview page to bullets of “this has been moved” and
        links to that info - aim to do this by next call or so
      - need to point people on mailing list to these pages/work, as
        some people are not following Github repo closely
      - then consider what to do with links to Overview page (including
        on License List page)

<!-- end list -->

  - readme in DOCS needs to be updated accordingly to above changes
