# SPDX Legal Team Meeting, August 5, 2021

## Attendees

* Candice Wright
* John Horan
* Paul Madick
* Sebastian Crane
* Steve Winslow
* Christina Chen
* Jilayne Lovejoy
* Brad Goldring


## Agenda
* Discuss creating a "technical issues" Milestone? or something similar?
* Finalize PRs for 3.14

## Notes
* General Meeting just prior to this one had 2 GSoC students present: one of which was a project for license matching using matching guidelines/XML templates. Will probably have a follow-up call with tech team on this to consider some things / potential changes. Built in Python
  * Not sure if it shows a diff or not

Technical Issues tag
* Most of the issues with this tag have been filed by Gary, and are separate from what the Legal team is working on, but some are connected to the most recent release milestone
* Does it make sense to tie the technical issue tag to a milestone?
  * At least with a milestone, even if it gets moved, prevents the issue from getting lost, with a review of how many times the issue has been pushed back (some have been delayed for years)
  * Tying the technical issue to a specific date (i.e. tech/legal joint meeting) instead of a milestone
  * Sometimes though a technical issue may not be currently fixable, so perhaps continue to leave it open?
  * conclusion: focus on the technical issues after the 3.14 release
