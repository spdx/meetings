# SPDX Legal Team Minutes, February 18, 2021

## Attendees:
* Mark Atwood
* John Horan
* Jilayne Lovejoy
* Karsten Klein
* Paul Madick
* Karan Marjara
* Ariel Patano
* Emmanuel Tournier
* Steve Winslow

## Agenda:

The primary agenda will be finalizing on issues and PRs for 3.12.

The 3.12 release is currently targeted to be this weekend. However, we are sorting through some issues with the CI setup for validating and publishing the license templates, so it is possible that this date will be pushed back as a result. We will keep you informed on further updates.
* TBD on timing, so keep working on 3.12  in meantime!
* As a result, tests are not running on PR - can still submit PRs, but don't merge anything until Steve says so

## Notes:

### Roles for SPDX org
* Jilayne and Steve to review role settings for SPDX org in GitHub, and clean up
* Should document to do review / upkeep annually

Reviewed issues, comments directly in threads

Will leave things as 3.12 for now while CI system work is in process

#1121 - discussed 2 levels related to acceptance: is this meet the inclusions guidelines and if so, should this be a license or an exception (because it includes and essentially put additional terms to GPL)
* cuts to what is an exception and where is the limit of what we include on this list?
* JL emphasizes "not a standalone license" part, but SW emphasized "grant an exception to a license condition or additional permissions beyond those granted in a license" in that everything on the list one could use the underlying license as the exception *adds* rights, doesn't narrow the rights
* Overall, this is indicative of lazy drafting - someone really wanted a different license than GPL, but instead drafted something on top of it
