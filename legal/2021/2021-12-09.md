## Notes

### Discussion of multiple languages (see below!)

Jilayne brought this up in 2017 at the FSFE's legal and licensing workshop. No decision was come to, so SPDX continued to add only one language in the XML (e.g. EUPL) unless the vast majority of licence texts found 'in the wild' used both (e.g. Mulan license).

### Issue 441

Hi! I'm taking notes below in the pink. We're duplicating effort here. (which is to say, please do help with notes! but there's no need for a second section for each topic)

### Dec 23rd meeting?

No objections, so will be meeting that day.

### Reviewing open issues

Hoping to close a bunch of older ones. Some are pretty obvious, so we'll be able to move quickly.

* Licenses translated to another language
* [Old wiki page about this](https://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/non-English-licenses)
* Policy around these is somewhat written up in the wiki page
* EUPL v1.2 is an example of how it's sometimes been handled in the past
* Mulan PSL, though, has entries for both languages
* The license steward uses the original language, for instance
* So it's difficult to have a single policy

* [451](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/451)
  * Appears to be an issue that should've been closed long ago
  * The analysis in the issue summarises the reasons for closing
* [456](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/456)
  * Ties into whether/how we track Debian- & FSF-approved licenses
  * JL & Gary have been talking to FSF about stuff in general
  * Related to [License List Publisher](https://github.com/spdx/LicenseListPublisher/issues)
  * Some of the team are OK to close, others think we should leave it open to wait for FSF
  * Will close in preference to the larger conversation with FSF about collaboration/coordination
* [876](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/876)
  * Is this related to/overlapping with conversations with other distros (Fedora, for example)
  * JL reiterates that Debian will need to recommend an automated method for this
  * Collaborate with Gary on this
  * Close in favour of that (eventual) automated method
  * Sebastian is on his way to becoming a Debian maintainer & may be able to look into this later
* [493](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/493)
  * MPL v2 includes a bunch of text-based formatting to highlight some sections
  * ************* <-- lots of asterisks
  * Should our files match that? How will our verification checker work with all those asterisks?
  * Steve: Will run a test on a branch
  * Sebastian ran a quick test & it broke on line 4
  * Sebastian provides some insights on how the checker may work with these
* [523](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/523)
  * Some license copyright statements are being tagged as software copyright
  * Not many licenses have this in them & Jilayne knows what they are
  * She'll work on this for 3.16
[576](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/576)
  * XML cleanup
  * Might make an interesting thing for new contributors
  * But probably better just to fix them as we find them
  * Should close this & open an issue for updating the documentation instead

### OpenSSL exceptions analysis

Jilayne has consolidated these: [1356](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1356)

She's [created a PDF](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/files/7507273/openssl-exceptions.pdf) that's colour-coded to show the various differences in the versions of the license

Three specific questions in the issue [starting here](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1356#issuecomment-964437122).

Steve has provided [some answers in the issue](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1356#issuecomment-971060655). Jilayne agrees w/answers to Questions 1, 2.

[Question 3](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1356#issuecomment-964439798) answer is more of a loose interpretation but so far are leaning toward the suggestion to consider this line as optional. Paul chimes in that it's a good candidate to be optional. SPDX handling for exceptions has typically been a little looser than with licenses. Have agreed to mark this as optional.


### Other stuff

* Sebastian has created a Dockerfile for working with the license repo
* Manages all those dependencies, makes it easier to run tests
* Will open an issue for contributing this & associated documentation
* Sebastian noted that if you hit '.' in the GitHub code view, it opens Visual Studio Code in the web browser
