## Notes

### Roles and projects
* Would love to get some volunteers for particular roles:
  * **License Request Steward**: Emmanuel
    * Pre-GitHub, new license requests would be submitted via mailing list; Dennis would respond to requester and update in tracking spreadsheet
    * Now done in GitHub, but would be great to have someone whose responsibility is to add labels to new requests as they come in; respond to ask where info was not provided
    * Bonus if possible: periodically send update summary list to mailing list
    * License Request Steward role, desciption:
    ** check new issues every few days: if there is a new license submitted as a new issue, add the "new license/exception request" label and add the appropriate milestone (generally next license release
 ** respond in issue to acknowledge submission (so they know we have seen it)
** check for completeness of submission (based on CONTRIBUTING description) - if it not, then respond in issue asking them to complete the request
**  if the submission is complete and if you have time, then review submission and provide your thoughts on whether it fits the license inclusion guidelines or not
** ideally: email mailing list every other week (maybe on non-meeting week) with direct links of licenses that need review
  * **Meeting Minutes**:
    * Role, description:
      * Taking minutes during the meeting in the shared Etherpad
      * Reformat into correct Markdown
      * Add to the repo at https://github.com/spdx/meetings
    * Will come back to this next meeting
  * **FAQ Review**:
    * More of a one-time thing -- review https://spdx.dev/faq/#licenses-1
    * Copy and paste into a Google Doc (or something else), mark it up with questions / edits / comments
    * Warner will take a first pass at reviewing this + adding comments; Steve or Jilayne will later handle getting edits onto the website
    * Google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WBV0f8L_ddUf9P3eUXMoCwQJiHSckWNA1ykNil8JxGY/edit

### License submission tool changes
* Rename "Comments" box to something like "Explain the purpose of this license" and/or "Justification", preference for "Explain why this license meets the license inclusion principles" (1st choice)
* Move it to the top of the form
* Make it mandatory
* On the intake side, have a policy: if it's a random submission, not complete or not responding within sufficient time, just close it out
* May want to add a bit more hand-holding for e.g., folks from legal teams who don't know GitHub and don't know what they need to do
* suggestion to move info related to contributing a new license and leave contributing as more general - supported by just on call
  * high-context topic, necessarily some complicated details
* Don't assume that all submissions come through the CONTRIBUTING file -- some tools (e.g. spdx-license-diff) point users to the submission page directly
  * Steve to follow up re: transition of published spdx-license-diff extension

next release schedule:
* been doing quartely but one month after calendar quarter (to accommodate lawyers who are busy at end of quarter)
* we were late on 3.12 due to some tooling issues, next release would be end of April, which is soon
* should we do the release at end of April - which would probably be a small release
* or should we skip April release and just aim for next release at end of July (and focus on clearing out old issues)
* could we automate release more? need to ask Gary or tech team on how more automation could be implemented (and they may be too busy to do that work at the moment) but worth looking into?
* does anyone on call have that knowledge? Alan will look at current steps and see if there are places for imporvements
  * Steve to send list of steps to Alan
* submitted at: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/issues/300
