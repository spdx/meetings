## Agenda:

The primary agenda for the legal team call with focus on reviewing current status of issues for 3.12.

For the 3.12 release, we made the decision to push the target release date out from end of January to current target of February 19. There are some problems we are sorting through with the existing CI setup for validating and publishing the license templates, so it is possible that this date will be pushed back further as a result. We will keep this list informed on further updates.

## Notes:

### Matching guidelines and markup
* spdx-license-diff browser plugin does not implement the matching guidelines directly
* Online tools (https://tools.spdx.org) will do an actual match using the matching guidelines
* Replaceable text on License List pages is generated from templates

### Licenses
* Looked specifically at https://spdx.org/licenses/Unicode-DFS-2016.html
  * Agree that first three paragraphs (identifying Unicode Data Files / Software) should be marked as optional
  * Less clear whether "Notice to user" section should be marked as optional
  * Given that Unicode's own use is inconsistent (it doesn't appear in the icu distribution version), and language seems reasonably likely to be substantive.
  * Jilayne checking whether "Notice to user" ever appears in the wild; may reach out to Unicode

* Looked at PR for FreeBSD-DOC on call; Gary reviewing to see why error in CI check is occurring

* Introduction to License Inclusion Principle for new comers in the meeting.
* #1110: Reviewing wrt the Guidelines. Rishabh to research more on <?>
