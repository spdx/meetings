## Agenda

close out any issues we can complete for 3.13 release and move the rest to 3.14

## Notes
* see: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.13
  * total of 21 open issues at start of call
  * 4 of the ones discussed last week where we asked the submitter to submit the final files have received no response.
  * We won't close the issues, but will move the milestone. Jilayne to comment on those remaining four.
  * 3.13 release should be out in the next few days
  * Sebastian requested to be added to the Github to be more available
  * without being added to the Github, users can still add/comment and do most necessary functions

Remaining licenses:
* #1191 - BSD 3 Clause No Military
  * This is verbatim to BSD 3, but with an extra statement about use in military facility. Is this sentence a "heads up" or a restriction saying that you canNOT license the software for use in a military facility.
  * This sentence is the exact same language as BSD-3-Clause-No-Nuclear-License
  * All three of the repos that use this license are related to blockchain and used by one company; but they are still examples of use in the wild
  * discussion on SPDX's role to not make judgment calls on licenses
  * decision: inclusion approved

* #1228 ACSL-1.4 "Anti-Capitalist" license
  * Many on the call believed the license is too restrictive, and voted to not add this license.
  * enforcing the restrictions doesn't seem very doable
  * Decision: inclusion denied

* discussion of background of license inclusion principles for newer members
