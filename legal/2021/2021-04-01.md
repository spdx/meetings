Christina volunteers to cleanup the minutes for posting

We'll start today's meeting with an update on the SPDX 3.0 Licensing profile conversation with the tech team earlier this week. After that I expect we will turn to reviewing issues for 3.13 and continuing the discussions from the last meeting.

## Notes

* FAQ page -- Werner had shared last meeting
  * Jilayne sent an  email to general list as follow-up to discussion on general call prior to this, but didn't see it come through - Steve confirmed he received it.
  * trying to update the website, especially the FAQs - needs a complete overhaul - questions needs reordering and more questions should be on there - good task for new members to contribute to
  * Jilayne undertaking the task of initial re-write and re-order and will communicate this task to members via general list for call for new questions
  * link to current FAQs: https://spdx.dev/faq/#licenses

* update on the licensing profile (Steve)
  * background/update: pending version 3.0 of spec will have a new format with different "profiles" - the tech/legal teams worked on a draft (in a Google doc) some months ago focusing on substance and reviewing current license-related field and looking to edits to make them for "artifacts" rather than at "package", "file", "snippet" (level as is the format currently)
  * current (2.2) spec: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/
  * e.g. Concluded License field description for Packages in 2.2: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/3-package-information/#313-concluded-license
  * submitted a pull request at what the profile will look like (very draft mode) - this is a first draft on the new profile format (in markdown, etc.)
  * how will the profile categories get translated into the automated schema that tool developers will be using
  * currently, the profile is in a "constained MarkDown format"
  * SPDX documents may be vary considerably, and cause problems
  * (Gary) Original idea was defining the profile for eveyrone to use, but the template may not suffice for all profile writers - agrees to merging the different documents (William, Jilayne, Kate to approve)
  * the current draft reflects what was agreed upon in calls with joint legal teams in 2020, goal for 3.0 - more commonly named fields
  * format is tentatively decided, but the question is whether there need to be additional fields to address bigger picture questions
  * If you are a consumer of SPDX doc and want to support more than one profile, we can't generate the schema files to validate the document supporting the multiple files
  * potential conflicts - if a document statically (or dynamically, etc.) linked to another, there's a list of relationship types; we want each profile to define the relationship type, but there's only one relationship type in the SPDX document. need to be able to validate as per profile for relevant relationships
  * another conflict example: in base profile is an artefact/package version number, which is considered optional; for the security profile, the version number if mandatory - the schema and tools have a hard time figuring out this interaction
  * suggestion - just have one document, but that's problematic if you have multiple pull requests for one document.
  * Jilayne will review profile for fomat, not substance
  * Steve is hoping to merge a couple of sections in the profile, and then add a few more new sections
  * an SPDX spec defines the SPDX field which is like the bill of materials
  * for 2.2 - all of the fields are together in one big spec; for 3.0, there's a bit more categorization - profiles are a way to choose the specs

(we had a quick overview discussion of license-related field in the SPDX spec as currently appear and how that relates to the SPDX License List for new folks and also how the new "profile" format changes this for 3.0)

* License List
  * https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues - the link where no issues/requests come in, and also where members converse if a license should be included in the list
  * whether to include a License is per the license principles, https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/DOCS/license-inclusion-principles.md
  * some issues are tagged 3.13 which is the next release coming up
  * reviewed a CC ShareAlike 3.0 license and approved its addition to the list; next create two different files into the repo: (1) plaint text of license, and (2) xml file that is a formatted version of the license
  * question, what about the language variants? CC is no longer bundling language variants the same way anymore so we don't add them by default, but if they're being used in the wild, we will add it.

* Jilayne added a link on an issue about deprecated licenses that can be discussed offline: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1082

* Warner brought up an issue about how contributors know exactly what the short identifier is referring to - especially in XML format
  * true, having only the short identifier isn't going to give you a precise use description, but  there are other ways to get the exat text, i.e. specify the file notice field.
