## Notes
* #1261: NLOD-2.0: this a new version of what's already on the license list, very minor edit. no objections on the call, and approved.
* Reviewed PR #1261 for NLOD-2.0: Sebastian suggested a couple of changes.
* For newer licenses, we add a property list variable
* Sebastian provided a command line tool:
`tidy -xml --indent yes -wrap 0`
tidy available at http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
* re: CC translations - we will add them if raised, just not proactively search for them
Thus, all six new German CC should be approved; plus 1 from Sebastian and Paul; approved.
* #1280: ABST - closing this submission that linked to a personal sales page; not OS related
* #1236: Programming-Unity-10.42 - Anthony didn't get any responses from the original poster. If there is demonstration of substantial use later, we can revise submission, but as of now, will not add.
* #1223 - bzip2 license - hold off on discussion till Jilayne joins
* Python's PSF license does not match the PSF that's in the SPDX list, which references Python 2.0 license. #1200: Python-2.0.1: Ariel and Candce to comment; reserved for future discussion.
*Could get Van Lindberg involved (as director for the Python Software Foundation)
* #1110: OPUBL-1.0 - assign to Sebastian
