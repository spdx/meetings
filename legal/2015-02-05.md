## Agenda

**1) Licenses Under Consideration**

  - NAIST IPADIC License, Short Identifier: IPADIC - not very commonly
    used, decided to put on hold for now
  - RSA Message-Digest License, Short Identifier: RSA-MD - MD4 and MD5
    are same license, but for naming, which can be dealt with via a
    template. ADD
  - CNRI Jython License, Short Identifier: CNRI-Jython - ADD, make note
    as to difference with CNRI-Python already on list

see spreadsheet for more notes:

**2) Adding or Making Changes to the License List Matching Guidelines**

  - discussion about making changes to the matching guidelines, in
    particular, adding something to the equivalent words
  - this can have an impact on tool-makers, should go to tech team for
    two weeks for comment, before being made official (Jilayne to send
    out)

**3) Any more feedback on 2.0?** - discuss via email
