1\) update on presentation Jilayne and Kate did at FSFE workshop on
non-English licenses

  - OSI shared their policy which is that they only accept it in English
    language and require a certified English translation
  - some activity on this on general mailing list as a result of
    presentation
  - point that putting a link is helpful but not saying it is an
    "official" translation
  - issue of tools and matching: Dennis shared approach for Scancode
    which treats any translation as same license and same identifier
  - seems ok to take word of author if they have multiple translations
    to use same identifier
  - but what if someone else does translation (not author of license
    itself)? how do we deal with that (in terms of translation)?
  - what about one language taking precedence over the other, if stated
    or not?
  - OUTCOME: set up a separate wiki page to describe a couple of the
    options we've come up with and then have broader groups review, etc.
