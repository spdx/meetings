1\) Tracking of new licenses in Google sheet

  - Dennis to update for newest release (calling 2.7 for now) to check
    against

  - also aim to do a license on call and keep line open for a hack fest
    to discuss as we work
  - did this on end of call

3\) Transition to “GPL-2.0-only” - and potentially removing "+" operator
(see:
<https://wiki.spdx.org/view/Legal_Team/or-later-vs-unclear-disambiguation>
) Steps needed:

  - get summary of other license “other version” to make sure no issues
    created by discontinuing operator "+"
  - discuss on legal call for Aug 3 based on above
  - joint discussion on tech call Aug 8 to discuss any other impacts
  - map out implementation and then report on general call

4\) revised text on exceptions description at top of that page

  - need to look at suggestions and normalize with revised
    recommendation in total
