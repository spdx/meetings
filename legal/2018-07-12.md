## Agenda

1\) Monthly SPDX General call was earlier today and GSoC student, Tushar
Mittal, presented his work so far on the online XML editor.

  - <http://13.57.134.254/app/> to try out tool in development and
    provide feedback. There may be bugs\! Function to make Github pull
    request directly is being added (so keep in mind if testing)
  - question as to whether generated PR comes from a person’s account or
    some generic; what about ability comment?
  - follow-on feature to have way to view-as-webpage option
  - we need to consider, when this is done, how does this impact/change
    the instructions for suggesting a new license:
      - want to keep email option for people who aren’t comfortable
      - or can use editor and generate PR directly? add option later
  - maybe update
    <https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/request-new-license> to align
    with
    <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>
    maybe just use the latter
      - update webpage to just have a link to CONTRIBUTING.md
      - update links to Request page on other pages elsewhere
      - once confident we have caught those pages, can get rid of
        webpage

2\) 3.2 is now live

  - update for 3.2 major changes to email list
  - explore adding “release notes” - is there a way to automate a list
    based on milestones going forward?
