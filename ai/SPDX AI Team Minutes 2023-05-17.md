* this work here seems to fit pretty well into Topic 1 in this one: https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/adversarial-machine-learning-and-cybersecurity/. Which is great. But then, the practical integration of the data engineer/scientist lifecycle is an important question.
* You need to add the required relationships, such as trained and tested. We also have to sanity check our profiles.
