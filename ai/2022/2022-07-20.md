## Notes
   * New Participant:   Yi Guo 
   
   * AI Application & AI Model - should we combine. 
      * AI Package profile when element of AI Application & Model
      * Litrature that breaks it into the 3.    Shows evolution as how to build an AI application.
      * Consideration of evolution over time.   
      * Need to build up the SBOM over time is key.
      * Jim notes that regulatory intent from FDA is aligning the two.
      * Karen will post some of the papers refering to.  
      * Decision:  first iteration, just 2 profile - 1 for AI Package Profile & 1 for Datsets Profile 
      * Gopi's tables to be combined and see where it goes. 
      * Remember its optional to apply the profile.   If chose to specify as package, then choose to apply AI package, expect that the mandatory fields would be filled in.    Subtlety between SBOM vs. AI profile in SBOM.
    * Merging of tables discussion
       * Open question about domain shift.   Ask Michael to help making case for how it's recorded and if it should be in 1.0.
       * Versions - may have period of time,   biometric data doesn't have a version, so probably will keep version as optional. 
       * Built date & Release date are optional because we may need to deal with streams.    Time period that the model trained over.   May be a time window. 
       * Next week:  Continue where we left off,   Gopi to show diagrams he's thinking about,  Derek to revise descriptions.
