## Definitions (for SPDX 3.1)

### Prompt (noun)
Instructions, including directly accompanying natural-language text, documents, code, and/or media, provided to an AI system by an external entity (human or otherwise) beyond the AI system’s static models, programming, and configuration files, to inform its output.

### Chatbot prompt (definition)
A discrete, externally supplied data object (text, code, image, audio, multi-modal payload, etc.) that is inserted into an AI system at run time, after its static weights, code, and configuration have been loaded, to trigger or steer the generation of a specific output for a single inference request.

Prompts must be either:
- **User prompt:** provided by a user (human or otherwise) and associated with a single query.
- **System prompt:** provided by the system’s owner/maintainer/administrator to inform the system’s overall behavior for every query (sometimes called an “instruction” in agent contexts).

### Context
The structured set of information made available to a large-language model or agent at inference time, encompassing all data and state data that influence the model's reasoning, outputs, and behaviour.

### Chatbot context (definition)
The complete, time-bounded set of run-time information that an AI system (model, agent, or hybrid pipeline) can reference when producing an output for the current inference request.

## Reference Definitions (ISO-oriented) and Related Inputs
- Elyas’s mapping example (mentioned; details not captured in notes)
- Existing AI Agent definition reference (before redefining, review): https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1294
- **AI Agent (ISO):** An artificial-intelligence system that, operating on behalf of a human or organisation, autonomously:
  1. Perceives its environment through sensors or data feeds
  2. Reasons over that input and its own state
  3. Forms goals or plans
  4. Acts upon the environment through actuators, APIs, tool calls, or other effectors to achieve those goals, possibly across multiple iterative turns without human intervention
- **AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) (ISO):** A design pattern in which an AI system, at inference time:
  1. Queries one or more external knowledge sources (vector stores, graph databases, document repositories, APIs, etc.)
  2. Retrieves the most relevant pieces of evidence
  3. Injects that retrieved information into the prompt/context of a generative model so that the output is grounded in data not present in the model’s original training set
- **AI system (ISO):** An artifact or deployed service that contains, or depends on, one or more machine-learned models (weights, checkpoints, etc.) and that, when executed, performs tasks that materially influence the behaviour, security, safety, or compliance of the supply-chain product

## SPDX 3.1 Status Review

| PR / Issue | Description | Critical for Core | Status | In 3.1 | Notes / Links |
|---:|---|:---:|---|:---:|---|
| 1110 | Add Prompt | N | WIP | Y | https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1110 |
| 1113 | Add AIAgent | N | WIP | Y | https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1113 |
| 1115 | Add AI RAG | N | WIP | ? | https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1115 |
| 1064 | Add AI/automationLevel | N | Tech team agreed; rename to `isoAutomationLevel`. Issue resolved in Nov 11 Tech meeting; PR completed by Arthit | (implied) Y | (PR link not captured in notes) |
| 1093 | Create Agent Tools property | N | Open | (not stated) | Notes: One suggested field `enabledByDefault` is now part of #1113. Proposed field (#1086) specifies an external tool an AI agent can operate. Core Agent class already includes referenced fields. Core Agent class: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Classes/Agent/ |

| 901 | Metrics for AI, standardised names | N | Open | Move to 3.2? | (link not captured in notes) |
| 772 | Strategy for security-related parameters for AI systems | N | Open (proposal sent to SPDX Threat WG) | Move to 3.2 | (link not captured in notes) |
| 892 | Add "synthetic" entry to DatasetType | N | Open | Y | (link not captured in notes) |

## Demos, Tools, and Follow-ups
- Victor: SPDX 3.* and automated tool demo presentation planned for next week. Request to record the talk to share with the broader group.
- Microsoft SBOM tool: question raised on update to 3.0 project and whether help is needed. Note: https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool already supports 3.0 (as stated in notes).
- Other reads / events:
  - Enterprise AI article: “Why Software Bills of Materials Are Your Best Defense” (reference mentioned; link not captured)
  - Marcus, November 15: “Generating SBOM” workshop (in-person): https://github.com/idlab-discover/sbom-workshop
- Decide when the last meeting of 2025 will occur (pending)

## Notes
- Updated BSI Technical Guidelines for SBOMs (EU CRA related):
  - BSI TR-03183 Part 2: SBOM, Version 2.1.0 (20 Aug 2025)  
    https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Technische-Richtlinien/TR-nach-Thema-sortiert/tr03183/TR-03183_node.html
  - Noted changes (per discussion): CycloneDX minimum version from 1.5 to 1.6; SPDX minimum version from 2.2.1 to 3.0.1 (referenced pages 2 and 11).
- Prompt/Context runtime capture: discussed how to capture run-time data for the Prompt/Context fields and that the group would address this before next week’s meeting.
- Arthit: `hasRAG` is not a relationship; it is a property. In PR #1110 it is proposed to be renamed to `isContextAugmented`. RelationshipType vocabulary reference:
