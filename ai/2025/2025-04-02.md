## Notes

### AI SBOM Tiger Team baseline (Art)

- Discussed in the call some of the gaps, and agreed to review offline, and then discuss in detail.
  Participants are encouraged to put comments in the document, and we'll walk through next week.
- Bob getting input from some MITRE customers on what they're looking for.
  Using AI & Dataset profiles together. Topic for next wednesday.

### Hardware Profile and common fields (Steven)

- Check overlap classes/properties in Hardware Profile (requirements, risk types, standards, measurements)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/977
- Energy fields are potential overlap - harmonization is needed.
- Can't replace current energy, but can add new parent in hardware - and then put in the 4.0 (with deprecation).
- May need add a new entry in RelationshipType for "training infrastructure for":
  - We need to be careful that "Trained on" is restricted to Data.
  - The “trained on” in “trained on Dataset” and the “trained on” in “trained on Hardware” have different semantics.
- Standard class - has been abstracted to be a type of Artifact, rather than just independent field.
  - Independent field is also being used in operations
  - We have 2 "standard" fields in 3.0 today (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/893):
    In Core https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/model/Core/Properties/standardName.md
    In AI https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/model/AI/Properties/standardCompliance.md
  - Earlier "Standard" fields proposal https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/387
  - StandardAndSpecification class -> consider renaming the class to Specification and add a new "spec status" property to tell if this is official standard, internal, etc.
  - Consider adding Specification body property (currently utilising originatedBy property)
- Has a training environment been captured in hardware profile?
  Pointing to pieces of hardware or set of hardware, etc. different locations.
  This is a use case that needs to be worked through.
- Victor flagged in the chat: "Sources of Irreproducibility in Machine Learning: A Review" https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07610 which we should work through to determine the sources of incompatibility
- How model supercomputers - looking from hardware perspective. FPGA simulation work.
- Gopi took action to work through an example of AI model being trained on hardware and give feedback to Steven.
- StandardDefinedHazard: /AI/SafetyRiskAssessmentType may not overlap with Hardware because at the stage of defining Hardware SBOM, the application is unknown yet so it is hard to assess risk. But this can be relevant to Functional Safety.
