## Notes

### Prompt discussion (AI Prompt PR)
Reference: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1110

- Art proposed adding `contextID` (in Software Artifact).
- Question raised: is Prompt better suited as a subclass of Dataset vs Software Artifact.
- Prompt Content concept:
  - Store a reference (URI or file path) to the actual prompt provided to the foundation model (FM) during inference or evaluation.
  - If the prompt is dynamically generated, indicate "no assertion".
- Question: is there a definition of "prompt" in the SPDX spec (needs PR).
- Discussion points on prompt scope and semantics:
  - Does the prompt include pulling data from other spaces?
  - Gopi’s view: prompt is the instruction to the foundation model.
  - Can a prompt pull in a dataset or not?
  - Prompt may have a datafile in it instead of inheriting.
  - Does a prompt have sensitive data?
  - Dynamic vs static prompts are hard to capture, especially dynamic.
  - Prompt depends on one or more dataset(s): which datasets were pulled in by the prompt?
  - Prompt as an individual interaction with the foundation model:
    - A series of prompts may be used to complete a task, but prompt is the smallest unit.
    - Prompt is an element where order can be defined, but SPDX model may not currently include an equivalent ordered list.
- Ordering and relationships:
  - Question: would a prompt depend on previous prompts, using linking to provide ordering?
  - Example: `Prompt2 --follows--> Prompt1`
  - A new `relationshipType = "follows"` was raised as an example (new relationship likely needed).
  - Question: single-turn vs multi-turn, and whether a field is needed.
- Context modeling:
  - Prompt contains context; system context also included.
  - Prompt CONTAINS Context.
  - Can prompt have no context (stateless system)? View expressed: context likely required for prompts.
  - Is context the same as dataset? Gopi: context is a type of dataset.
  - Prompt is not the same as source code; context is the broader environment where source code is running.
  - Prompt is more like context conceptually; prompt is part of context.
  - Need to define Context class and model Prompt CONTAINS Context.
  - Context properties discussed: includes history, dataset(s), etc.
- Next steps identified:
  - Gopi and Elyas to work on modeling, but approach not yet clear.
  - Working call needed with (Raymond, Sean, Gopi, Elyas, Bob, Karen).
  - Elyas noted memory storage solutions should be included in these discussions.
  - Request to review/update web page information for AI and Dataset profiles.

### AI and Dataset profile web page updates
- AI Profile Revision: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUzcWHbKqwy9eZ-soMiNHbiI9tquTbw2m0nY8JpOwqk/edit?tab=t.0
- Dataset Profile Revision: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCMBDFA0RjZV1Evu9XC_eyjKufMiadh_g526AgZPeVI/edit?tab=t.0
- Request: review and provide updates/feedback (noted as "PLEASE").

### Relationship types (urgent)
- Relationship types are in SPDX 3.1 CORE and were noted as urgent due to a deadline described as "yesterday".
- Review scheduled on agenda for Oct 14 SPDX Tech call at noon ET (request to join if possible).
