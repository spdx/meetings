## Announcements and context

* Schedule: The 2025-12-17 meeting is the last meeting of 2025. The first meeting of 2026 is on 2026-01-07.
* New group: LF Agentic AI Foundation (reference link): [https://archive.ph/2025.12.09-171630/https://www.wired.com/story/openai-anthropic-and-block-are-teaming-up-on-ai-agent-standards/](https://archive.ph/2025.12.09-171630/https://www.wired.com/story/openai-anthropic-and-block-are-teaming-up-on-ai-agent-standards/)

## Discussion notes

* Dataset size measurement units: A proposal was raised to support additional units for dataset size to align with regulatory expectations (examples cited: EU AI Act style needs such as tokens for text, image counts, and time duration for audio/video). This was noted as a previously discussed topic from the period when the European Commission released a GenAI technical documentation template. The group questioned whether a spec change is needed now.
* Proposed taxonomy of supply chain entities: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15763)

* SPDX AI WG website update (Art): [https://spdxai.github.io/](https://spdxai.github.io/)
* Definitions for prompt/context: whether any further discussion is needed before posting SPDX Definitions and moving content into GitHub terms and definitions. Reference doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMNReyGbksLYlBGjawn0NYSKvR8NSe6s0QCcrNpLLys/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sommjn515yo2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMNReyGbksLYlBGjawn0NYSKvR8NSe6s0QCcrNpLLys/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sommjn515yo2)
* SPDX 3.1 slide library “kickstart”: Bob trialed a slide library at an OMG meeting. Reference deck: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GaL9fGpvY9n2JUEBZ0L3tkZ9W6GCx-CnGQ038BpBRYQ/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GaL9fGpvY9n2JUEBZ0L3tkZ9W6GCx-CnGQ038BpBRYQ/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)

## AOB notes (personas, entities, and definitions)

* Bob Martin shared an initial list of role categories relevant to defender-oriented frameworks (examples: CTI analyst, threat hunter/SOC analyst, red team/adversary emulator, security architect/control owner, risk/leadership).
* Observation noted: MITRE public materials (ATT&CK, Atlas, D3FEND) describe audiences and workflows, but do not publish a canonical cross-framework persona catalog.
* Continuing threads:

  * Expand Raymond’s articles on “Entities.”
  * Merging ontologies proposed as a topic for next week or early January; consider using relationships to link ontologies.
  * Threat modeling as a potential basis for scoping SPDX definitions of roles.
* Prompt and Context definition discussion (including prior comments from Sean):

  * Revisit earlier definitions (referenced as “1.1” and “1.1.2” in discussion notes).
  * Need to exclude “ML system” (Gopi’s concern).
  * Gopi concern: AI definition is too vague.
  * Raymond shared US and ISO definitions of AI; direction noted as using ISO/IEC definition for SPDX.
  * Suggestion noted: remove “reasoning” wording.
  * Question raised: broaden from “AI model” to “AI system” (e.g., whether guardrails are part of the model/system boundary).

## Decisions captured from the notes

1. PR 1158 approved for inclusion (profile conformance relaxation).
2. Directional decision recorded: given changed design direction in the AI WG, the Prompt, AIAgent, RAG, and Agent Tools items are expected to shift to 3.2 with current work potentially closed and reintroduced later as updated PRs.
3. Directional decision recorded: proceed with ISO/IEC definition framing for AI terms; remove “reasoning” wording (as discussed).
