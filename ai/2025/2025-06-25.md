- Karen Bennet, IEEE
- Victor, Self

## Agenda

- Approve previous minutes
- Prioritise agenda
- General announcements
- Elyas: Presentation on SBOM Prototype tool
- Gopi Presentation on MCP ecosystem analysis
- Round Table

## Notes

- Elyas will share the google sheets of approach/design used for building the AI SBOM Generator tool
  - Use case 1: Creator of Model or Dataset
  - Use case 2: Multifacet SBOM
  - Use case 3: Model/Dataset already deployed
  - Next phase to integrate with other SBOM Generator
- Croissant Data Card should be reviewed
- Microsoft currently updating SBOM Generator tool also working on Agentic AI SBOM.
  - Link to Microsoft SBOM-tool: <https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool>
  - The SBOM tool is a highly scalable and enterprise ready tool to create SPDX compatible SBOMs for any variety of artifacts.
  - The SBOM tool supports SPDX 2.2 and 3.0.
- AR: Gopi to create a block diagram (get link of the whiteboard document)

- MCP ecosystem paper: <https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13538>.
  - Analyzed all the MCP servers for the challenges.
  - Very active and healthy communities.
  - MCP has new characteristics that have vulnerabilities.
  - We need a new registry for this type of software (new type of weakness). CWE categories (has an AI Working Group) and they would love our feedback.
  - The plan is to create a list of new CWE. <cwe@mitre.org> <https://cwe.mitre.org/community/working\_groups.html>
- Victor: OWASP is only working with CycloneDX. What is the advantage of CycloneDX?
