## Agenda

- Any New Members Introduction
- Setting Agenda for 2025
  - January plans
  - Google SLSA - What it is and their plans for 2025
    - <https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/increasing-transparency-in-ai-security.html>
    - <https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/introducing-googles-secure-ai-framework/>
    - <https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency>
    - <https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-ai-saif-risk-assessment/>
    - Helen: structured provenance data from SLSA could probably facilitate
      the generation of AIBOM;
      - Question lies in interoperability - aligning SLSA provenance schema
        with AIBOM schema
- SPDX License - Start to plan integration of AI data licenses with Steve
- Hugging Face - How to report on SPDX BOM with Megan
  - Helen: currently Hugging Face APIs are focused on discovery of AI models
    and datasets; IF those APIs are extended with transparency need for AI,
    then potentially, this could be a first step in generating AIBOMs for
    3rd-party models
  - To consider: in addition to that, there is a need for standardization of
    model and dataset metadata on HF (and industry overall)
- MLCommons - 2025 Plans to standardize AI benchmarking: Geoffrey Fox
- Collaboration Activities underway
  - AI Policy Standard with Open Chain - rescheduled to meet on Jan 14
  - Kate's spreadsheet on comparison (fyi, OpenChain-Fujitsu has a similar one)
  - AI Readiness with MLCommons <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NbL-VdkrY9jzPxveOys2RCK8TdEJ7O5wgnxjAgzK-rE/edit?usp=sharing> (Outline at this link)
  - AI use cases with CISA underway - consider hav ing SPDX example for each
- February schedule? Start to look at additions for 3.1
- Any Other Business
- New whitepaper planned for <https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2025/fse-2025-industry-papers>
- Tech call yesterday also discussed provenance,
  upcoming tech meeting Ilans will present about PROV-O ontology
- Need Tools !!!!
- Granularity and expressiveness of the two use-cases differs enough that
  current SBOM formats were deemed not a good fit for the requirements of the
  Build track.
  - Yet SBOMs are a good practice and may form part of a future SLSA
    Vulnerabilities track.
  - Further, SLSA Provenance can increase the trustworthiness of an SBOM by
    describing how the SBOM was created.
