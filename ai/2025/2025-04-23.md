## Agenda

- Approve previous minutes
- Posting zoom link (that I use: <https://zoom.us/j/92452702075> - Karen),
  but Kate's the official owner of the invite
- Changing where SPDX AI/Dataset Minutes are sh captured- same process to get them archived on GitHub though
  <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q2a2HAV\_ipbPhV6pqWWqzxYjBaTKtIW7H\_CfAFF0kek/edit?tab=t.0>
- Baseline (CRob) to share plan/strategy - see how to involve SPDX
  <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/158wTTo4pW9RlOfEFd0H9-DiL3GeDRVN6i\_ZqkoVi1Ws/edit?gid=0\#gid=0>
- Industry standard security checklist
  - ISO9001- example: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2DPgXrQyGY6nSSWyF6\_lmZzma3NHL3y/edit>
  - Why not start from an existing standard and add if there are gaps. I know that AI risks/threats are missing.
- Relook at Elyas's hardware examples
- OECD Towards a common reporting framework for AI incidents
  <https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/towards-a-common-reporting-framework-for-ai-incidents\_f326d4ac-en.html>

## Notes

### OECD

- OECD for policy makers / going for ISO approval
- MITRE - more for developers and root cause
- Gaps if we were to harmonize the two:
- Jurisdiction
  - OECD: Tracks geographic or legal jurisdiction (e.g., EU GDPR, U.S. FTC).
  - MITRE: No equivalent; technical incidents are jurisdiction-agnostic.
  - SPDX: Field being added to 3.1
- Regulatory Status
  - OECD: Notes whether the AI system is in a regulated sector (e.g., healthcare, finance).
  - MITRE: Focuses on technical harm, not regulatory compliance.
  - SPDX: Changes to regulation fields in 3.1
- Policy Recommendations
  - OECD: Suggests governance reforms (e.g., stricter auditing).
  - MITRE: Focuses on technical lessons, not policy advice.
  - SPDX: Nothing capturing technical or policy lessons learned
- Cross-Border Coordination
  - OECD: Flags incidents requiring international collaboration.
  - MITRE: No equivalent; incidents are treated as isolated cases.
  - SPDX: Nothing
- Code Snippets
  - OECD: Avoids technical specifics to maintain policy neutrality
  - MITRE: Allows sharing vulnerable code or configuration examples.
  - SPDX: Nothing
- Adversarial Techniques
  - OECD: Doesnâ€™t classify attack methods
  - MITRE: Tags attacks (e.g., model inversion, data poisoning).
  - SPDX: Security Profile?
- Mitigation Steps Taken
  - OECD: Focuses on reporting, not remediation.
  - MITRE: Documents how the incident was resolved (e.g., patch details).
  - SPDX: Nothing
- Versioning of AI System
  - MITRE: Tracks software/hardware versions (e.g., TensorFlow 2.8).
  - OECD: Omits versioning to generalize trends.
  - SPDX: Core - versioning
- Attack Vectors
  - OECD: Uses broader categories like "cybersecurity failure."
  - MITRE: Specifies vectors (e.g., API exploit, training data tampering).
  - SPDX: Security?

### CSA mapping of AI controls

- Victor: Cloud Security Alliance AI Controls Matrix (AICM)
