## AOB

* AI Safety from SPDX perspective
* Start assembling “What’s new in 3.1” materials for AI/Dataset profiles (slides, etc.)

## Notes

* Gopi and Elyas provided an update and demo of the BOM generation tool for generating SBOMs for data and AI models; planned to be published publicly by end of year or early January. A beta will be provided to the AI/Dataset profile WG community for testing. Gopi also submitted a FOSDEM submission about the tool.
* Brainstorming on what else is needed for the SPDX AI WG website ([https://spdx-ai.github.io/spdx-ai/](https://spdx-ai.github.io/spdx-ai/)). Suggestions included adding more papers to the list and adding links to other SPDX sites. An action item was taken to show updates to the Outreach team on Monday.
* SPDX Entities / Persona discussion was held to better understand why this information matters. CosAI is interested in the final paper on this topic.
* Victor requested a decision on whether patent information will be included in SPDX or not.
* OpenSSF LF-AI plans to discuss OVI vs CWE next week. Bob presented discussion points supporting the CWE path as preferred, since it is established and well-understood in the development community (CWE treats AI as a software architecture concern).
* Summary video on the journey associated with Context and Prompt definition (upload link): [https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC-CmG5S4q-1yJMqgY8kC9ww/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC-CmG5S4q-1yJMqgY8kC9ww/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D)
* Shared an initial stab at “What’s new in 3.1” talking points for the AI/Dataset profile.
* AI-Prompt, AI-RAG, and AI-Agent PRs are closed; the group indicated readiness to open them and start completion of release work. Follow up with Art regarding reopening.
