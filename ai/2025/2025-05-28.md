- Prioritise agenda
- **Presentation: AI-generated code and annotation with SBOM - Damon**
  - AI-generated source code security use cases
  - How to store information in the SBOM that "AIPackage A" generated "Code snippet S"?
  - Temporal scope: How to describe that an SBOM is only valid from commit hash A to commit hash B?
- Papers
  - A Semantic Approach for Linked Model, Data, and Dataspace Cards

## Notes

- Looking to be able to represent whether code has been generated by AI or person
- Mayur and Damon work for Blackduck, AI SBOM with Hugging Face models, etc.
- Marcin works on C2PA for model signing
  - Paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19567>
  - <https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Artificial-Intelligence-AI/Building-Trust-in-AI-An-End-to-End-Approach-for-the-Machine/post/1648746>
  - <https://github.com/IntelLabs/atlas-cli> (to be open)
- Damon starts the demo by asking GitHub Copilot to write a hearts game.
  - He shows how Blackduck tool (not released yet), which sits between the IDE and the AI model, can detect IP leakage in the source code.
    - Snippet matching (not open source) <https://documentation.blackduck.com/bundle/bd-hub/page/ComponentDiscovery/Snippets.html>
  - An SBOM is generated.
  - The idea is to show how many percent of source code is generated.
  - **Relationship/properties used in current SBOM:**
    - **AIPackage (gpt-4o) –suppliedBy→ Tool (Copilot)**
    - **AIPackage (gpt-4o) –generates→ Snippet (source code)**
    - **Snippet –originatedBy→ Person (who type the prompt)**
  - generates ([RelationshipType](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Vocabularies/RelationshipType/%20)):
    - “The `from` Element generates each `to` Element.”
  - [originatedBy](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Properties/originatedBy/) (from [Artifact](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Classes/Artifact/) → Agent)
    - “Identifies from where or whom the Element originally came.”
  - [suppliedBy](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Properties/suppliedBy/) (from [Artifact](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Classes/Artifact/) → Agent)
    - “Identifies who or what supplied the artifact or VulnAssessmentRelationship referenced by the Element.”
  - Discussion on the relationship: Kate noted that should switch “suppliedBy” and “originatedBy”?
    - Since both Tool and Person are Agent, it can be in either way – but this also brought up a question that if we would like to constraint it, we may need to have a way to differentiate human Agent and non-human Agent?
    - But after another read, it looks like both of them (originatedBy and suppliedBy) follow closely the current 3.0.1 definition.
- It is possible that in one commit there is a security issue, then the next commit overwritten parts of code and the issue is no longer there. The question is does SPDX currently record something in between? Or does it only record the final (at last commit)?
  - Multiple commits of code is similar to Multiple layers of container image building (like in Docker)
  - Kate: Any point in time, you can export the SBOM (document).
- “Prompt” is not documented here since it is not the intention to document the interaction, only to document who produces what.
- Art asked about the deterministic vs non-deterministic nature of “generates” relationships. Kate responds that the relationship is designed with the generation of evidence in mind as well and it is not explicit about the deterministic nature. It is the best one currently that does the job. But we need to check this with Gopi as well.
