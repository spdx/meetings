## Notes

* Agreement to use InLanguage in Dataset Profile as defined in [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1066](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1066) / or other use cases presented at this time.
* Concern that context needed to be included with the automationLevel ([https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1064](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1064)). Raymond provided an automated car example (on road and off road are different); consider adding the field and note that it can be different for the same model. Hardware has this type is this automationLevel. Raymond pushback on this idea, since you need a risk assessment level.
