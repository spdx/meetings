## Notes

### AI/other profiles overlap

- At least 3 overlapping fields:
    1) Measurement/Quantity/Unit (including Energy consumption)
    2) Trained on Dataset (existing) + Trained using Hardware (new)
    3) Standard/Specification/Regulation
        3.1) standardName and standardCompliance properties (existing)
            <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/893>
        3.2) Standard class (proposal)
            <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/387>
        3.3) Regulation (proposal)
            <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1015>
        3.4) Specification (proposal) (from Hardware Profile)
            <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/977/files#diff-02ac9a20fa03bca23a67844db527b8cbec7ba86292a74a4743b9437e9aebd87b>
            - The "mandatory" property is optional
- Please also refer back to 2025-04-02 AI Team meeting
- Need examples for discussion
- Hardware group will review on Friday, then will review in Tech group again
- Need harmonization for 3.1. Something will be deprecated.
- UnitOfMeasure. The meeting agrees that the abstraction is generally good.
  - Art comments that we may need a better name. UnitOfMeasure name does not remind of quantity property.
- Keep "sensor" property in DatasetPackage
  - sensor in DatasetPackage is information about sensor used in the collection of data, including information about sensor calibration
  - Hardware Profile focuses on the sensor hardware itself
- Data collection process currently is a string in DatasetPackage; If we have it as a class, it will be possible for different Datasets with the same collection process to link to the same "Process" class
- Kate suggests to start open PRs for new AI class/property for 3.1
  - Elyas will be able to present that next week
