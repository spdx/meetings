## Notes
- Previous minutes approved? Not yet; will do that after call.
- Courtney and Gopi asked a number of questions about inheriting from other profiles.
- Reviewed Agent and Prompt fields in spreadsheet and assigned which profile each will be defined in.
- Question: In case we want to align the field names with other prompt markup languages (e.g., POML), only if cardinality is different.  
  - https://github.com/microsoft/poml
- Steven listed the relationship vocabulary reference:  
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/model/Core/Vocabularies/RelationshipType.md
- Art mentioned proposing reuse of `usesTool`: “The from Element uses each to Element as a tool, during a LifecycleScopeType period.” To Tech team.
- Add input and output modality and use:  
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/model/Dataset/Vocabularies/DatasetType.md
- Add `finetunedon` relationship.
- Security is a good example of restrictions for “datatypes”.
- Consider adding input to prompt modality.
- Maybe use “Memory Usage” in Software profile? AI agent has memory or not, so it is different. Needs to include knowledgebase (i.e., information that the AI has access to).
- Remove “external” since there are external/API tools and internal/built-in tools.
- Change to `storedmemory`.

## Outstanding Action Items
- Gopi to create a block diagram:

- Courtney to add to agent name.
- Gopi / Elyas to finalize 3.1 list and identify any fields that might need to go to CORE.
- Gopi: can this PR be merged into 3.1 branch (sensitivePersonalInformationType enums)?  
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/106
