# SPDX AI Team Meeting 2025-10-29

## Attendees

* Alfred Strauch (Smart Talk)
* Arthit Suriyawongkul
* Courtenay Ngo
* Elyas Rashno
* Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur
* Karen Bennet
* Raymond Sheh
* Steven Carbno (Smart Talk)
* Victor Lu
* Wenxin Jiang

## Agenda

* Approve previous minutes: [https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pulls](https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pulls)
* General announcements
* Review `hasInput` and `hasOutput` relationship types for AI and data use cases
* Consider relaxing external property restrictions of `AIPackage` and `DatasetPackage`

  * Example: not every package is distributed via online distribution, so `downloadLocation` may not be available
* Consider relaxing profile conformance requirements for AI and Dataset profiles

  * Forcing `hasDeclaredLicense` and `hasConcludedLicense` can lead to many `NoAssertionLicense` outcomes
* Continue Prompt, Context, and AI Agent discussion

## Notes

* Nick Chase requested feedback on his paper (long version): *The AI License Layer Cake: Open Source, Data Rights, and Model Lineage* (Google Docs).
* Gopi shared a paper Nick may find relevant: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09873](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09873)
* Victor discussed OWASP efforts on AIBOM: [https://owasp.org/www-project-aibom/](https://owasp.org/www-project-aibom/)

  * OWASP AIBOM Project weekly meeting: 12:00 pm US Eastern Daylight Time / 16:00 UTC
  * Join the OWASP Slack workspace and the `#project-aibom-community` channel for the Zoom link
* Alfred is taking CRA requirements and mapping SPDX to those requirements

  * Discussion starts Friday, 9:00 am US Eastern Daylight Time / 13:00 UTC
  * Same link as Hardware/SupplyChain WG
  * Action: Please loop Courtenay into the CRA efforts
* Karen will consult with Gopi on the rationale for making `releaseTime`, `suppliedBy`, `downloadLocation`, `packageVersion`, `primaryPurpose` mandatory for `AIPackage` and `DatasetPackage` in 3.0 (they are not mandatory in [Software] `Package`), and evaluate whether to relax this in 3.1
* Other news: Microsoft has adopted SPDX
