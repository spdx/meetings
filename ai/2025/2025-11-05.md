# SPDX AI Team Meeting 2025-11-05

## Attendees

* Alfred Strauch (Smart Talk)
* Arthit Suriyawongkul
* Aruneesh (OWASP AIBOM project, new)
* Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur
* Karen Bennet
* Raymond Sheh
* Steven Carbno (Smart Talk)
* Victor Lu

## Agenda

1. Approve previous minutes
2. General announcements
3. Guest(s) from the OWASP AIBOM project
4. Welcome new members
5. Definitions

   * Review “AI”, “AI SBOM”, “AI SBOM Compliance” definitions in the OpenChain AI SBOM Compliance Management Guide 1.0
   * Consider whether AI and Dataset profiles require entries in the spec “Terms and definitions” section (example: Hardware)
   * Note: preference to align with ISO terminology (ISO/IEC 22989:2022), per Karen
6. Review Prompt, Context, and AI Agent definition discussion (update from 2025-11-04 meeting)

   * AI Agent definition exists in the SPDX spec PR; review ISO definition before redefining AI Agent after Prompt/Context are finalized
   * Raymond scenarios supporting the assertion that user prompts should follow their contemporaneous contexts
   * As Prompt/Context definitions and use cases finalize, consider moving content into a published PR
7. SPDX 3.1 status review (AI and Dataset related)
8. PR cleanup (label active items Draft/WIP; close stale items where possible)
9. Victor’s SPDX 3.* automated tool demo planning (request to record for sharing)
10. Microsoft SBOM Generator status for SPDX 3.0 support and whether help is needed
11. Other reads / community items

## Discussion Notes

### Welcome and Introductions

* Aruneesh introduced as based in New York and leading the OWASP AIBOM project, with involvement in additional AI and AppSec initiatives.

### OWASP AIBOM Project (Guest Discussion)

* OWASP AIBOM positioning: global view of “AI BOM”, including tooling guidance spanning both CycloneDX and SPDX, and operational guidance for SBOM usage.
* Discussion included SBOM protection considerations for organizations.

### Definitions: AI, AI SBOM, and Compliance

* Reviewed the OpenChain AI SBOM Compliance Management Guide definitions for “AI”, “AI SBOM”, and “AI SBOM Compliance”.
* Discussed whether AI and Dataset profiles require additions to the SPDX specification “Terms and definitions” section, using Hardware as an example reference.
* Noted preference to align with ISO/IEC 22989:2022 AI concepts and terminology (Karen).

### Prompt, Context, and AI Agent Definitions (Follow up from 2025-11-04)

* AI Agent definition is already present in the SPDX spec PR; group should review ISO definition before making changes after Prompt/Context are finalized.
* Continued discussion on Prompt and Context definitions; updates maintained in the shared working document.
* Gopi raised concerns about using “information payload” terminology rather than “data”; Raymond revised Context wording to address these concerns.
* Raymond presented three scenarios (created using Claude) to illustrate Prompt/Context relationship expectations, including that user prompts should follow contemporaneous contexts.
* Next step suggestion: as definitions and use cases converge, publish content via PR.

## SPDX 3.1 Status Review (AI and Dataset Related)

### PR Hygiene

* Cleanup request: label actively worked PRs as Draft/WIP and close others if possible (status noted as potentially “done”, but not confirmed in notes).

### Demo and Tooling Updates

* Victor planning SPDX 3.* automated tooling demo for next week; request to record session for broader sharing.
* Microsoft SBOM Generator: question raised on current status of SPDX 3.0 support and whether assistance is needed.

## Other Items / Reads Mentioned

* Article mention: “In Enterprise AI, Why Software Bills of Materials Are Your Best Defense”.
* Workshop mention: Marcus, November 15, “Generating SBOM” (in-person), workshop repository referenced.

## Action Items (Extracted)

* Bring `AI/automationLevel` prior discussion notes to next week’s tech call (reference to July 2025 notes in PR discussion).
* Consider recording Victor’s upcoming tooling demo for sharing with the broader group.
* Continue convergence on Prompt/Context definitions and transition mature content into a published PR when ready.
* Perform PR hygiene pass: label Draft/WIP appropriately and close stale items where feasible.
