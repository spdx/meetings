## Discussion Notes

### Prompt and Context definitions
Reference definitions under PR #1110 files:
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1110/files

Current working definitions referenced in the notes:
- Prompt: the input text, instruction, or data given to an AI model to initiate and guide its generated output.
- Context: the information provided to the model that shapes or influences its generated output. Context includes Prompt.

Open point: Gopi raised a use case argument that needs to be resolved.

### Decision-oriented outcomes
- System and User Prompts should be included in definitions work (suggestion from Steven).
- User Prompts get added into Context (agreed).

### Follow-up and research inputs
- Suggestion that everyone reads the Context Engineering paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13334
- Raymond’s revised document from today’s discussion (updated): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMNReyGbksLYlBGjawn0NYSKvR8NSe6s0QCcrNpLLys/edit?usp=sharing
- Microsoft Azure Playground Foundation definitions to be reviewed.
- Courtenay volunteered to look through Microsoft Learn documentation for definitions associated with “context”.

### Raymond revised definitions (for consideration)
Prompt (n):
Instructions, including natural language, documents, code, and/or media, provided to an AI system by an external entity (human or otherwise), beyond the AI system’s static models, programming, and configuration files, to inform its output.
Prompts may be user prompts or system prompts.
- User prompt: provided by a user (human or otherwise) of the system and associated with a single query.
- System prompt: provided by the system's owner, maintainer, or administrator to inform the system's overall behavior for every query.

Context (n): (Raymond opinion, explicitly noted as such)
All of the data specific to a particular session and used by an AI system to generate output beyond the AI system’s static models, programming, and configuration files.
Context includes the current user prompt (or a representation thereof).
Context may include:
- the system prompt,
- supplemental information provided (for example by RAG or agentic retrieval systems),
- a history of past prompts, outputs, contexts, and other data (possibly compressed, abbreviated, windowed, or otherwise curated).

### Use case prompt
- Arthit asked whether the group can consider use case examples of how the AI and Dataset profiles might use the hasInput and hasOutput relationship types.

### Industry note
- Courtenay noted Microsoft plans to upgrade the open source SBOM tool (https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool) for AI applications. It is currently at a 2.x version and they are looking to move to 3.0 for Core, Software, Licenses, and AI and Dataset profiles to generate an AI BOM.

## PR Cleanup
- Request: label active PRs as Draft/WIP and close others where possible.
- Elyas to clean up some PRs before next week’s meeting (per notes).

## Action Items
- Elyas: Clean up AI-related PRs (label Draft/WIP as appropriate; close where possible) before next meeting.
- Karen: Set up a key definition meeting as soon as possible (Prompt/Context/System prompt/User prompt alignment).
- Courtenay: Search Microsoft Learn documentation for definitions associated with “context”.

## Decisions
- User prompts are included within Context (agreed).
- Definitions work should explicitly account for system prompts and user prompts (directionally agreed; details pending definition meeting).
