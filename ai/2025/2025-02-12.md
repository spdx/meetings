## Notes

### SPDX Examples

- AI Example 02
  - Looking for reviewers (Gopi and Karen volunteered)
  - Use validator in VS code; but mostly manual still at this point.

### Interop

- Should we be a superset of everything?
  - There's a push back for that.
  - The meeting agrees that "no".
  - Art's comment that we should have a standard at the enum level.
  - Mentions of Croissant and DCAT and Google Playbook
    - <https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/docs/croissant-spec.html>
    - <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/>
    - <https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe>
    - <https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/data-cards-playbook>
  - Interop between formats, keep things workable (nicely) for everyone
- S in "SPDX" is now for System, which includes data and hardware.

### Comparison with other WGs

- Elyas presents Dataset Profile comparison with other WGs
- Put link to Elyas's spreadsheets here
- Lisa: from the table, it looks like a lot to digest,
  should we have a minimum set of metadata?
  - Kate responds that that's the direction to have a set of mandatory fields.
- Art: At different stages of AI lifecycle:
  1) requires different metadata (as mandatory), and
  2) has different availability of metadata
- Art: We may consider something like BOM Maturity Model to think about
  difficulty/availability of information
  <https://scvs.owasp.org/bom-maturity-model/>
- Robert: Interests from governments to use SBOM for regulatory and other purposes.
  Should we go toward a standard core SBOM that can be augmented for a particular purpose/use case?
- Art: During a FOSDEM side event, there're ideas about having one single SBOM
  database with different renders/views for different target audience/use cases
- Gopi: We should try to come up with the maturity level for each of the field
  - Art added that after the small group exercise, we can also have a survey to ask wider group of people
  - This can be used as input to decide about mandatory fields and for updating the whitepaper
- OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide is a good example for expectation settings of SBOM for a particular use/industry
  - <https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG>
  - <https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain-Telco-SBOM-Guide_EN.md>
- "Meta Grid"
  - Fundamentals of Metadata Management - new book that we should take a look at,
    by <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ole-olesen-bagneux/>

### Whitepapers

- Keep spreading the AI BOM whitepaper:
  - <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/ai-bom>
  - The AI-generated version of podcast (by Karen) works but sounds repetitive, can be improved
  - A short summary/table of the full whitepaper? Make is more accessible.
  - Need ideas to spread and get more people adopting
  - Translate the whitepaper to the target's language;
    For example, lawyer/regulator language, safety practitioner language
- Lisa: Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)â€™s DataOps draft on DataBom
  <https://docs.google.com/document/d/13h9G8XvNkgN998077CHPS1bfxkpFw6gYWps1IxI35yc/edit?usp=sharing>
  - We can contribute to this
- Call for Presentations for Open Source Summit North America
  - Deadline: February 16 at 23:00 PST
  - <https://cd.foundation/cdcon-2025/>

### Outreach
