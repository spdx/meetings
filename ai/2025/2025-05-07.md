## Attendees

- Alfred Strauch
- Bob Martin
- Elyas Rashno
- Jean Campbell
- Steven Carbno
- Victor Lu

## Agenda

- Review of Hardware profile

## Notes

- Various creation components for hardware: assemble, manufacture, harvest and reproduce
- Defined process, specification, regulation (related to specification)
- Boundary, responsibility, ownership, custody, destroy
- Actions an action is an event produced by a process
- Digital location points to a specific digital unit
- Unit of measure - QUDT points to specification uses external identifier
- Specification and regulations conform to a specification “hasEvidence” for proof
- Mapping specification
- Capture BOM with cryptography - discussed in cryptography meeting
- Note: License list idea may be used for algorithms
- Hardware Version is critical for training model - link to country
  - Country restrictions is part of hardware
  - Restriction is on the company and/or hardware
- Hardware export restriction related to use of hardware for AI
  - This version may be only for x company or country
  - X product can be sold to restricted country - based on version
    - Timeline issue on hardware
    - May require a separate class - with restrictions - restrictions change over time
    - Is a restriction like a regulation? - reuse regulation
    - Is a regulation a system specification?
    - See example: [Nvidia tweaks flagship H100 chip for export to China as H800 | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-tweaks-flagship-h100-chip-export-china-h800-2023-03-21/)
    - Different supply chains: software, hardware, data
      - Mature graph related to SCs
      - Upstream and downstream possible
      - Build profile is a set of actions - can discuss pipeline for build in V4
      - Muli dimensional SCs will be need in the future
