## Notes

- Hasan presented the Databrick's framework for regulations and vulunabiliites
- Strategy; What risks, what are the controllers
- What are the differents between traditional software and ML models
- Security is the top concern (and more challenging with GenAI)
- How can we manage the risk: 7 components (Tech, People/Process, Trust, Controls, Risks including AI, Threats and Architecture)
- Try to building practices to address the 7 components (requirements, build, development and deployment)
- How to make it easier to manage risk in AI systems. Created 55 risks for each of the compoents (data, model and application)
- Created risk "use cases" and detailed the Risks/controllers
- Mapped all risks to regulations, NIST, Mitre, EU Act, ISO, etc.
- Hasan's spreadsheet:
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNfPWWrHMLkTS_Bgitd5geHy__M_bEOo/edit?gid=272285622#gid=272285622.
- Implementation / controllers added (AWS, etc) into spreadsheet
- How is feedback coming into (like the mapping to controller
- Q: Bob, is it free to use; lots of copyrights. Databruicks created. Mitre is reviewing the weakness of AI.
- Would it be useful (CWE/Mitre classification), SEI is talking with Mitre Altase individuals
- Q: Elyas, Did you also take into account/Agents in the risk  assessment; They looked at LLM RAGs in the assessment
- Community: CMU, Databricks
- Q: Victor - DataOps https://cd.foundation/blog/2025/01/23/announcing-dataops-initiative/ might be of interest to this project; Hasan will try and get involved
- They got feedback on can other components be added?
- Trying to build an AI SBOM, evaluating OSS tools, Databricks is also investigating
- Consider using Mitre's Layered Threat approach
  https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/282.html
  https://capec.mitre.org/data/index.html
- Mitre has over 600 Threats that might be worth consider
- Next release of spreadsheet (networking community group): Hasan can get anyone invited
- Todo: Karen to send OpenSSF GenAI frameowrking "9" components, Elyas to share a paper/Agents
- Any gaps in SPDX: domain and hardware
  - https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/issues/808: Legal topic for next week
  - License information in Data and Model profile: Legal topics; OpenChain lawyers

## Next Week's Agenda
- SPDX Legal (Steve Winslow)
  - Future plans for SPDX Legal and different options for hosting non-OSI licenses ef RAI within SPDX)
