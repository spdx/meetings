## Announcements

* Next meeting is on **2026-01-07**. Holiday greetings were shared.

---

## Discussion Items

### 1) New PR proposal: additional units for dataset size

The group revisited a previously discussed need: dataset size measurement needs to support multiple units beyond a single “size” concept. Regulatory templates (including EU AI Act-related technical documentation templates) can require:

* Tokens (text)
* Counts (images)
* Time duration (audio/video)

The group aligned that this should be implemented and moved forward as a PR.

### 2) AI/Dataset PR Status Review (SPDX 3.1 and beyond)

### 3) Proposed taxonomy of supply chain entities (paper)

* Paper referenced: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15763)

### 4) Merging ontologies: Persona List (whitepaper)

* Working document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1piPBgXRCBeBFKeNnYmABJiwjQPrYDMp35BpBP5sJMcU/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1piPBgXRCBeBFKeNnYmABJiwjQPrYDMp35BpBP5sJMcU/edit?tab=t.0)
* Bob Martin noted he is not familiar with the Defender persona list, and the group needs an alternate method to source/validate those roles for the paper.

### 5) SPDX AI WG website update

* Website referenced: [https://spdxai.github.io/](https://spdxai.github.io/)
* Art to provide/update status.

### 6) Definitions work (Prompt/Context and AI System)

* PR input for SPDX Definitions (Prompt/Context) based on Raymond’s document:

  * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMNReyGbksLYlBGjawn0NYSKvR8NSe6s0QCcrNpLLys/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sommjn515yo2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMNReyGbksLYlBGjawn0NYSKvR8NSe6s0QCcrNpLLys/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sommjn515yo2)
* Raymond raised a broader definition concern: definitions should cover AI systems (not only AI models), including questions such as whether guardrails are part of the “model” vs part of the “system.”

Candidate “AI system” definitions reviewed:

* 15 USC 9401 definition (US Code): [https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:15%20section:9401%20edition:prelim)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=%28title:15%20section:9401%20edition:prelim%29)
* ISO/IEC 22989:2022 definition
* EU AI Act definition (Article 3): [https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/3/](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/3/)

---

## Decisions Made

1. Prompt and Context definition: The group reached consensus on the definition text; Raymond will post the agreed text for inclusion in SPDX glossary and Terms and Definitions section.
2. AI System definition: The group agreed to adopt the EU AI Act “AI system” definition as the preferred definition, as it is broader and fits agentic AI more naturally (does not explicitly mention humans in the definition).
3. PR disposition: PRs/issues related to the earlier Prompt, AIAgent, and RAG designs were closed with the intent to reintroduce updated designs as new PRs targeting 3.2.
