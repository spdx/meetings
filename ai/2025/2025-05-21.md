### C2PA Presentation

- Presentation from Eric Scouten (Adobe) from Creator Assertions Working Group and also Scott Perry works from C2PA
- “Where did this image come from?”
- 4 Pillars of transparency and authenticity: Provenance, Education, Detection, Policy

  - (2024) Creator Assertions Working Group (Technical Standards: Who) <https://cawg.io/>
  - (new) Decentralized Identity Foundation <https://identity.foundation/>
- C2PA data model. Asset is described by “C2PA Manifest”.
- C2PA Manifest can refer to “Ingredient Manifest” when earlier content is used.
  - “Assertions” are opt-in statements that cover areas such as: hard binding to asset’s binary content (provides tamper evidence), capture device details, edit actions, thumbnails, ingredients, etc.
    - Including “CAWG identity assertion”, that indicates authorization of or active participation in the creation of the asset
  - “Claim”
  - “Claim signature”, bind Claims to X.509 certificate holder
- C2PA Manifest is a JUMBF data structure
  - JPEG universal metadata box format (JUMBF) - ISO/IEC 19566 <https://www.iso.org/standard/84635.html>
- Identity assertion that relies on social media account, a website, an identity documentation, etc.
- Product make assertions, cryptographic binded
- Entity/person makes claim/assertion, cryptographic binded, but this does not constitute anything legal. But the claim/assertion provides information - more signals in the marketplace for making decisions.
- Bob: IETF standards about claims – IETF’s Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT) Working Group has standards about assured claims <https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/scitt/documents/>
