## Attendees

- Ambarish Gurjar
- Arthit Suriyawongkul
- Elyas Rashno
- Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur
- Mihai Maruseac
- Victor Lu

## Agenda

- Approve minutes: <https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3AAI>
- Victor: Standardization options: Flexibility (add whatever you want) vs interoperability
  (less fields, more constraints that guarantee something will work together)
- MLCommons Croissant dataset metadata <https://mlcommons.org/croissant/1.0>
  - Intro <https://research.google/blog/croissant-a-metadata-format-for-ml-ready-datasets/>
- Discussion about common elements between SLSA and SPDX,
  and how we can bring useful things to SPDX 3.1
  (in a way that can still keep the interoperability)
- SLSA Provenance <https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance#schema>
- PROV-O <https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/>
- <https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/tree/main/python/mlcroissant>
- Possibility to join MLCommons working group?
- Mihai: SLSA has a link between input, build, and output and has more optional fields.
  SLSA doesn't care about most of the mandatory fields in other profiles like SPDX
- Gopi: How we can find a starting point for SLSA and AIBOM.
- SLSA has not the dependencies like SPDX.
  Three fields are mandatory in SLSA including release time, build time, and version.
- Is there any way to find out the verification of the fields in SPDX based on SLSA?
  (In the relation dependency field, the verification should borrow from the SLSA verification)
- Should find the overlap between SPDX and SLSA fields.
- Croissant is a high-level format for machine learning datasets that brings
  together four rich layers.
  <https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant>
- Find the overlap between croissant and SPDX, come up with some mapping

## Action Items

- Link SLSA Provenance to SPDX (Mihai)
- Summarize Croissant, how it aligns with SPDX, and present to the group (Art)
