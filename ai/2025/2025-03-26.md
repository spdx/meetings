## Notes

### Hardware Profile

- Research Hardware overlap fields to discuss for April 2 meeting
- Diagram: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/bf90e3f1deb213c2732ecead0d4cce193ce56f9f/images/Hardware_Image_Temp_drawio.png
- Some fields worth looking:
  - Specifications: model/Core/Classes/StandardAndSpecifications.md
  - Hazard (related to AI risks?): model/Hardware/Properties/hazardType.md
  - Measurements (related to Energy): model/Core/Classes/UnitOfMeasure.md
  - Contact points (for AI product/service registration e.g. for EU AI Act):
    For example, model/Core/Properties/headquartersLocation.md and
    model/Core/Properties/streetAddress.md
- Overall, it’s not just Hardware, it’s Hardware + Hardware Logistics (Actions)
- The Hardware Profile borrows a number of fields from GS1 https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gln
  - GS1 famously do things on product barcodes (not only for retail but also for transport/logistics)
- We may like to find a slot and invite Hardware Profile team to present

### CRA: Discussion

- Open Source Steward definition?
- Evaluate SBOM Europe and SPDX where are differences
- CRA Readiness - relying on upstream survey
- Article 14 impacts open source steward
- EU Vulnerability database (harmonize CVE numbers between databases) as another CVE organisation (apart from cve.org)
- cve.org Other organizations can add CVE and CWE
- Recording timeline for vulnerabilities are set
- BSI for support fields;  SPDX has them covered
- Peter (from MITRE on Slack) working on MITRE attack.  
- MITRE Response to White house request; SBOM is discussed for AI systems
- SPDX needs a knowledge graph for D3
- Co-marketing between SPDX and MITRE
- MITRE ATTACK only captures real attacks
- SPDX middleman for model, data and software and hardware
- get Peter to create examples for Defend and SPDX; invite to SPDX Tech call
- 3.1: Operations, Hardware, Software as Service :  end of year for 3.1 release
- 3.0.1 is ISO release
- https://d3fend.mitre.org/
- euve.eu  - name of EU vulnerability database
