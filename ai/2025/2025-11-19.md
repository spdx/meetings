## Action Items

1. Submit PR #1158 to the Tech team for review.
2. Confirm holiday scheduling decisions: December 17, 2025 (last 2025 meeting) and January 7, 2026 (first 2026 meeting), and decide on whether to meet during US Thanksgiving week.
3. For PRs/issues #1110, #1113, #1115, and #1093: close current items and plan new PRs later aligned to the updated AI WG design direction (targeting 3.2).
