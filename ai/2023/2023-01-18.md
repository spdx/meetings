# SPDX AI Team Minutes 2023-01-18

## Attendees
* Kate Stewart
* Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur
* Sen Hastings
* Karen Bennett

## Agenda
* ICSE paper on SBOM - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05362.pdf
* Model Example - MIT Example
* Upward AI profile.

## Notes
* ICSE paper discussed - some reservations about it.

* Model example:
* Karen contacted the MIT team, they are interested in publishing.
* They liked the "valid to date" but don't use it today.
* Limitations are cases that the model cannot do. Biases in the recognition of things, etc.
* Model types: people don't want to share too many details, reinforcement learning.
* Information about the training, has it been modified/filtered, what process was used.
* Domain change: do we need to get a better definition of Michael? Change of Domain or Domain.
* Programming languages, etc. They should be in "Application information".
* Funding Sources - "General Comments" or "Application Information"

   *Should we document how to write a good SBOM and add SBOMs? Agreement
* Gopi: Mind spore has an older version for 200 data BOMs. Press for examples with the latest after stabilizing.
* Karen: fiddler.ai enters the dataset documentation space and encourages others with more examples: Conferences? IEEE. AI.ia?

* Discussion on AI profile and data set update.
* reviewed the draft of the presentation - continue to push it this week.
* putting it upstream in the next couple of weeks.
