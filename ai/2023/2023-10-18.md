## Notes
General meeting - Catch up
* Karen shared that tools spreadsheet not ready to share, but still working on it.
* The both of us discussed the number oa LF AI groups and general purposes of them  like LF AI-Data(https://lfaidata.foundation/).
* There is considerable overlap and lack ofcommunication between the different groups needs to be improved upon.
* LF-AI-Data has a landscape of tools (https://landscape.lfai.foundation/)  that we should see if any can be modified for AI/Data profile automation
* We discussed changing now using bias as one of the fields in AI profile, since it's really not bias but  documenting the statistics of the type of data used in training
* Andreas shared potential collegues that we might want to work with: https://adrian-gonzalezsanchez.medium.com/  
* Andreas shared a tool that he developed that will be of interest to us: https://reuse.software/
