- Discussion on 3.1 fields
  - Prompt-related properties and relationships
    - System prompt
    - System prompt provenance
    - Size of the system prompt
      - Prompt size (in tokens, etc), or input/output size in general
      - Max size supported for the system prompt
    - Prompt technique
    - Foundational model-runtime configuration (dict)
    - Computational resource consumption
      - In addition to the existing energy consumption
      - Training time/resource consumption (FLOPs / to decide on unit(s))
      - Inference time/resource (GPU) 
      - Deployment time/resource (GPU)
    - Seperate system prompt and user prompt
    - May need a Prompt Profile?
    - We need to think about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  - Relationships
    - fintunedOn - Relationship that links a dataset profile to the foundational
      model (FM) and describes what dataset the FM was finetuned on
