## Notes

- [Kate] We need to find out the different types of diagrams that we need to do for AIBOM
  for different types of SBOM
  - Diagrams: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E7iAcHlrXizBUePUTzE5hDD3rA_J-fm7VDp2kW1joVE/edit#slide=id.g2726d5e68b4_0_9
  - Apart from interactions between AI and Dataset (profiles), Hardware (profile) will be in the picture as well.
- Question: Do we need another relationship for validation dataset
  (currently we have trainedOn and testedOn  for traning and testing)?
- Question: Do we also need "finetunedOn"/"tunedOn" for generative AI? Also "alignedOn"?
- Question: Should we have a different relationship ("groundedBy") for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?
  - RAG is almost an application/database in itself. Will be more complicated.
- Generalisation: Does it possible to use the existing relationships for new applications/use cases?
  - For example, "testedOn" for validation? "trainedOn" for fine-tuning and alignment?
- Having properties for all types of AIs (predictive, generative, etc) may be cumbersome.
  Another option is to have subclasses for generative AI, etc.
  Those subclasses can have different properties/cardinalities that fit for the use cases.
  - Refer to https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model%20AI.png
  - New GenAI have fields that may not make sense for traditional options.
- We want to start looking into how make freeform text fields into more structured input.
- Thinking about how to represent multimodal & multiagent systems.
  - Information about input/output type/format.
- Agent provenance. Agent representation is going to be a large issue.
- General questions:
  - How to represent gen AI?
  - What is the template for regulatory purpose?
  - What is the required information for Operations?
  - These can also be depend on the platform the AI system is being run on.
