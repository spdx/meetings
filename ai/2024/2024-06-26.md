## Notes
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/791 -- No objections, approved
- AIBOM Tiger Team: https://github.com/aibom-squad/AIBOM-Tiger-Team
  - Karen, Helen, Victor, Arthit were in the Tiger Team meeting on 24 June 2024. Helen is one of the lead.
  - This SPDX AI/Data Profiles Team meeting discussed about the role and the deliveriable of the AIBOM Tiger Team.
  - AIBOM Tiger Team works around use cases, which will translated to components and fields.
    It will produce an overview paper on that.
  - The Tiger Team may not stick to a particular standard.
  - How SPDX and AIBOM Tiger Team can work together.
- Dmitry shares Mitigating Artificial Intelligence (AI) Risk:
  Safety and Security Guidelines for Critical Infrastructure Owners and Operators
  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/24_0426_dhs_ai-ci-safety-security-guidelines-508c.pdf
  - A mention of AIBOM in this document
- Discussion about the openness of AI model and other components
  - Can I use this publicly available dataset to build commercial AI software? -- A Case Study on Publicly Available Image Datasets https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02374
  - Model Openness Framework
    - https://isitopen.ai/
    - https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2024/04/17/introducing-the-model-openness-framework-promoting-completeness-and-openness-for-reproducibility-transparency-and-usability-in-ai/
- A question on AI BOM at different stages. Could use these:
  - https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Core/Classes/LifecycleScopedRelationship/
  - https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Core/Vocabularies/LifecycleScopeType/
  - We may need to review these life cycle scope types as well,
    if they are sufficient for AI/model development -- particularly for GenAI.
  - For example, can we use the "test" type for AI model test?
    - It currently defined as:
      "test: A relationship has specific context implications during an element's testing phase, during development."
  - If it is not enough, 3.1 may be an opportunity.
- Continue SPDX 3.1 Fields discussion
  - Gopi concerns about the roadmap. What should be the output? The group agrees on having a roadmap.
- There should be a more structure on which week we will focus on maintenance mode (3.0)
  and which week on design/development mode (3.1).
- Think about this as a product development, and we need a product management
  - Design
  - Development
  - Maintenance
  - Documentation
  - Marketing, etc.
