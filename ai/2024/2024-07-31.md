## Notes

- To update meeting time in spdx/meetings/README.md + Calendar
- hasDataFile description update https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/815
  - Name change/Type addition is not possible for 3.0.x
    - Can add "hasArtifact" in 3.x (like 3.1)
    - Can remove "hasDataFile" in 4.0
  - Gopi proposed to clarify on dependency, also incorporate Gary's suggestion on using the term "Artifact".
    The meeting agreed to add:
    "A data file is an artifact that stores data ... This relationship does not imply dependency" statement.
  - Approved to merge as it is for 3.0.1
- Karen to merge https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/743
- Discuss about whitepaper finalization, plan to release it around the time of 3.0.1 announcement
  (first weeks of August)
  - Would be nice if we also have examples from AI and Dataset Profiles by the time
