## Notes

- AI/Dataset examples discussion
  - AI Profile Example 01 https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/80
    - Alexios made a review on format and license
    - Arthit made a PR to make it pass validations
      https://github.com/rgopikrishnan91/spdx-examples/pull/2
  - Question about expected behavior of license relationships
    - If the license is in the SPDX Licenses List, should we able to use the IRI directly in the `to` property?
    - For example, `https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0` is in the [SPDX Licenses List](https://spdx.org/licenses/)
    - But currently this snippet will violate SHACL model - it says that `to` wants a value of Class `Element`
      ```json
      {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "spdxId": "https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/someId",
        "creationInfo": "_:creationinfo",
        "relationshipType": "hasDeclaredLicense",
        "from": "https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/someId",
        "to": [
          "https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0"
        ]
      }
      ```
      See an example of an error at: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/80#issuecomment-2179288271
    - The workaround now is to add a license Element (CustomLicense, LicenseExpression, AnyLicenseInfo, etc.)
      with a spdxId being that IRI. Something like:
      ```json
      {
        "type": "simplelicensing_LicenseExpression",
        "spdxId": "https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0",
        "creationInfo": "_:creationinfo",
        "simplelicensing_licenseExpression": "CC-BY-4.0",
        "simplelicensing_licenseListVersion": "3.24.0"
      }
      ```
    - The meeting is agreed that the expected behavior is to use the IRI directly
      without the need to create yet another Element.
      This should be confirmed with the tech team.
      - Update 2024-06-20: Alexios confirmed the expected behavior.
        But SPDXv3 RDF license definitions are needed to be generated first in order to have that.
        See: https://github.com/spdx/LicenseListPublisher/issues/183
