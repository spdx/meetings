- Helen Oakley
- Karen Bennet
- Sandra Hermosa Rodriguez
- Victor Lu

## Agenda
- SBOM a RAMA Update ?  - lots of comments about AI Readiness concerns
- 3.1 model
  - Some of the fields that may be useful for AI incident reporting use case?
    - Why We Need to Know More: Exploring the State of AI Incident Documentation Practices
      https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604700
- Summary: highlights the need for more comprehensive and detailed AI incident
  documentation practices to support the development of safe and equitable AI systems.
  By learning from past incidents, capturing detailed timelines, and adopting approaches
  from other industries, the AI community can build a stronger understanding of AI incidents
  and define practices to avoid failures in the future.
  Potential SPDX fields:
  - Impact: stakeholders (e.g., users, businesses, society)
  - Impact: categories (e.g. loss of confidentiality, loss of integrity)
- Suggestion: for this group is to create paper/whitepaper specific guidelines and
  best practices for documenting AI incidents with SPDX and how to use the information
    - Addressing AI Risks in Critical Infrastructure: Formalising the AI Incident Reporting Process
      https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT62155.2024.10677312 - anyone have copy of paper?
- UN just published a guide to global AI governance:
  https://www.un.org/en/ai-advisory-body;  and looking for individuals/groups  to work with them 
  - Suggestion: write proposal to use SBOM/eg SPDX to document AI governance rules
- NIST has released four publications intended to help improve the safety,
  security and trustworthiness of AI systems,
  include final reports on Generative AI, Secure Software, and AI Standards and Draft of Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models.

  They have kickstarted the next working group, synthetic data
- SPDX 3.1 Roadmap:
  - AI/Dataset: New fields (GenAI related)?
  - Human Interaction: Prompts, RAG,  etc
  - Threats, Behavior/Context: such as impact, etc
  - Quality/Metrics: tbd, what other themes
- AIBOM minimum fields (aka MVP) as per AIBOM TT:
  - Model Source
  - Model Version
  - Model Performance Metrics
  - Model Dependencies
  - Model LIcensing Info
  - Data Source
  - Data Types / Classification
