    - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/84 - CO2 dataset

## Notes

- All meeting minutes (except one) approved, ready to get merge
- Agreed that Dataset Profile description should be a generic one and not AI-specific.
  However, an AI use case can be mentioned as it is one of the major use cases.
- Review the revised autonomyType description - Accepted
  - Arthit mentioned that autonomyType is more straightforwarded to use xsd:boolean
    (than current PresenceType). We can discuss further.
    Btw, changing that will break compatibility. Maybe for future versions.
- Examples
  - The custom license in Gopi's simple HTR is probably ready for review
  - Karen will find suitable people to review the all the 3 examples
- Gen AI information needed to add in 3.1
  - Recap last week on prompt-related field
  - Do we have papers that listed fields for Gen AI BOM?
  - We should start to do some PRs related to the purposed fields
- Helen & Karen: life cycle and phrase of SBOM.
  - Should align with the MLOps process in the industry
  - Need again papers that listed this down. At least we should use the same names.
- Helen: We need minimum set of information at each stage in the life cycle.
  Each stage will have a different BOM. It will be dynamic.
  Not a single static BOM for the whole thing.
  - Ask about this in the next General Meeting (July)
- Victor suggests to collaborate more with OpenSSF and also SLSA
  (Look at Google paper https://research.google/pubs/securing-the-ai-software-supply-chain/ )
  Google expands it in the area of provenance.
  One of the things is the attempt to put all information into GUAC
  (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition) as a single source for analysis.
- More papers from Victor
  - Model Cards for Model Reporting
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993
  - Data Cards: Purposeful and Transparent Dataset Documentation for Responsible AI
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01075
  - SLSA 1.0 Provenance https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance
- Joseph (in chat): "I will be attending meetings on ISO/IEC 42001 (AIMS)
  with BSI later this month and looking at topics on Data Governance,
  Algorithm Transparency, Accountability Frameworks and of course Ethical considerations"
- Martin (in chat): "Sigstore is a good companion for attestation.
  We used it with SPDX 2.0 for "sigining" and validating SBOMs for containers."

## Decisions

- Ask about dynamic BOM (for different AI  life cycle) in the next General Meeting call (July 2024)
- Ask about collaboration with other related projects, particularly within Linux Foundation
