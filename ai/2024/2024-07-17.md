## Notes

- Three people shown up, discussed a bit about what is a good time slot for meeting.
  - 10pm Europe time is probably too late.
  - Different time for alternating week can be an option.
- Everybody left at 20:11. - Thanks everyone,  will try and talk with Kate/Gopi this week so that we can resync these meetings with a time that works.  My plan is to address the open PRs.  I had Bob Martin scheduled to come to talk with us today about Sbom lifecycles (how and why) you use that field, and have just sent a request to see if he can change the talk until next week.
