## Notes
- OpenChain survey group being converted in to working group(s); we need to  be more actively involved with these folks
- Victor suggested that SPDX examples are needed in the TT discussions, it's too CyxlonesDX focused
- TT AI BOM, is still evolving, and decision is to  focus on software not AI systems
- Alan has highlighted at several CISA metging - focus on SBOM only,   they are not be used properly yet
- SPDX - Dependency tracking into database (from implementation calls-SPDX is doing the work)
