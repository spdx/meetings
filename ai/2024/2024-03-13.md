### Discussion
- Update from Tech Team Meeting: Because of the profile prefix from the namespacing update
  (see Tech Team minutes 2024-03-12 and https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/651#issuecomment-1979368441),
  there's an opportunity to rename classes/properties to make it shorter by removing the redundant part.
  For example, `AI/AIPackage` can be just `AI/Package` since it will be prefixed with `ai_` to be `ai_Package`
  in the serialization. It is up to the Profile teams to decide if they like to rename.

## Notes
- New members:
    - Mihai Maruseac from Google and https://github.com/ossf/ai-ml-security
    - Parth Patel from Kusari and https://github.com/guacsec/guac
- Helen asked about the relationship between SBOM and AI SBOM, also the purpose information of AI/Software.
  Wouldn't all information in AI SBOM will eventually be integrated into Software SBOM?
  - AI system purpose needs to be documented.
  - Need purpose in both SBOM and AI SBOM. SPDX is moving to define context.
  - Arthit posted the following in chat
    "EU AI Act: data original purpose, model intended task, and system intended purpose"
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/653. Said it may related to the discussion.
    Currently, we have `domain` property in `AIPackage` and `intendedUse` property in `Dataset`.
    They are all free-form text now though, so not that machine-readable or easily
    comparable across different artifacts.
  - Arun shared his view from MLOps, DataOps, and DevOps perspectives.
    SPDX Dataset, AI, and Software Profiles can fit into those Ops.
  - Karen clarified that S in SPDX is now System, not Software.
  - Gopi pointed out Yes, But this was a purposeful first step and we are hoping to converge
    to a completely machine readable interpretation in the future.
  - Need to explain deploy BOM, more dynamic type BOMs. need some examples
  - RSA plans to have a AI BOM workshop.
- On Profile prefix in serialization and an opportunity to rename/shorten property/class names:
  - As a group, we decided to keep the names descriptive at least for this version.
- Slack channel : https://join.slack.com/t/spdx-sbom/shared_invite/zt-2en0v2kdi-uUb7YCvpgRldT1s8RIiLtw
- Mihai asked about use cases that are not legal/compliance.
- Mihai asked about tooling for 3.0. Karen updated that Linux Foundation will soon publish
  a list of SPDX tools with information on which SPDX versions (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.0) that they support.
