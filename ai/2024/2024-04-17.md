### AI model metadata in Hugging Face (and other platforms)
- Discussion about standardized way to record model version and license information in
  popular code/model repositories
- Model versioning:
  - Dmitry points out that it is difficult as a software developer who wants to use an AI model
    from a public repo like Hugging Face because he needs to refer to exactly a model with
    a specific version but there's no standard way to specify model version on HF.
  - Lots of AI model developers adopted some conventions putting version number in the
    file/directory name inside a repo. But there's no standardized way (like SemVer).
    Some use "2", some use "v2". Some do not specify version number at all.
  - Dmitry said that this forced him to use a commit hash as an ID.
  - Arthit put in the chat that the commit hash is unique but it has no semantic
    (like which one is a newer version).
  - Arthit added that Huggice Face does support model versionig through "revision"
    property, but people rarely use it. See the API doc:
    https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained.revision
    The revision property is actually from from a Git branch name or a Git tag name.
    (Hugging Face underlying infrastructure is Git).
  - Dmitry responded that as the revision field is not enforced when a developer update
    the model, few people use it.
  - Dmitry and Karen agreed that we need to start discussions with Hugging Face about
    what fields should be manadotry for code commits i.e. version number.
    There is a GitHub hosted LF Working group dsicussing some of these issues,
    that Hugging Face might be interested in joining.
- License information:
  - Karen asked about license information. Dmitry responsed that Hugging Face,
    like GitHub, relies on a convention of putting a license text file inside the repo and HF
    will just take it to display on its status bar.
  - Arthit points out that this is not reliable. Because in the same repo, it can have both
    source code and model and they can use different licenses, but HF will pick only one
    of them. So we cannot tell right the way if the license shown in the status bar is a
    license for the model or not.
