### Discussion on Synthetic Data Type
- Recommend using data collection field; still need to figure out proposal for indicating it is synthetic.
- ARM would like to flag when code is generated by LLM.

### CISA Tiger team AI BOM
- Proposing additional fields for minimum elements.
- Performance benchmarking is a field that they would like to broaden out.
- Karen & Sandra went to functional safety profile, and suggesting there.    Verification? 
- For 3.1;  for initial draft all the fields;  look at across all profiles; rather than pigeon hole.   
- Karen has draft of all the fields that should be included in 3.1,  possibly need for other profiles. 

### OpenChain input from David Marr:
- Training dataset inclusion should be optional in 3.1
- Raw data and dataset used for training data/curated

### 3.1 model
- Next week, have start of the document for 3.1;
  and this time around, highlight who is indicating the need for the field.
- Next week, ask Helen about deeper dive on SAP analysis of SPDX
- New minimum elements (containing licensing now) is available at: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/SBOM%20Framing%20Software%20Component%20Transparency%202024.pdf
- SAP did analysis of SPDX, and compared to model card variations.
  - 60% of everything out there we include, and they didn't see anything that we needed to add.
  - 4 use cases, SPDX had all the fields.

- Remaining with Data (rather than changing to Dataset for 3.0) will revisit in 3.1 - Karen to open PR
- Eyas went through prompts for fine tuning LLMs;  prompts are very fragile.    Folks are looking at prompts as binaries, and need to capture something.   Fields to support RAG are being looked at as proposal for 3.1
- Quantum/Crypto - possible being handled in other locations?
- Victor interested in some of the use cases that are not in the shared drive see:

### Linux Europe Summit Update:
- Requirement (kernel team) for FUSE Profile
- Molly - reconnect - security certification with AI
- EU AI Act into Requirement - Gopi
- SPDX meetup - talk about translation (volunteers for Japanese, Korea, and Chinese)
