### Other AI related WG Updates
- SBOM Everywhere - https://hm-seclab.github.io/SBOM-Landscape/
- CISA Update: Transition from “What’s an SBOM” to “We have an SBOM, now what?”;
  - SBOM Tooling categorization: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKPIjT7Rfc38F0OMuXIlPqFRoH7wj2H8x3w13Pgy8V4/edit#heading=h.3kcprhiiv0b8
  
### Foundation Models
- Gopi to show a paper that might be useful for SPDX 3.1
  - Rethinking Software Engineering in the Era of Foundation Models: A  Curated Catalogue of Challenges in the Development of Trustworthy FMware https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15943.pdf
  - Offers a way to think about how to treat foundation model as a component in software system

### Upcoming Events
- SBOM-a-Rama: Tomorrow (Feb 29 @ noon ET) https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/events/sbom-rama-winter-2024
  
### AI licenses for 3.1
- Karen mentions the ongoing effort to add AI licenses to 3.1
- See https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-legal/message/3510 and https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1622

### Gap analysis for 3.1
- Arthit updates the group about discussion to amend SafetyRiskAssessmentType in 3.1 to accommodate risk levels in EU AI Act https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/650

### Dataset
- Ways to specify datasets?
- Dataset profile is good to understand the properites of data but challenge of context ie.  data portion used to train model

### Use cases
- Victor mentions about the need of use cases for AI and Dataset Profile
  - Users tend to include every fields in the SBOM, probably wrongly, because they don't know how to use it.
  - Having relevant use cases along with the spec will help the users understand better on how to use SPDX
  - Security Profile has use cases here (see links below), AI Profile should aim to have something similar:
    - https://spdx.dev/capturing-software-vulnerability-data-in-spdx-3-0/
    - https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Security/Classes/CvssV4VulnAssessmentRelationship/
    - https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/main/security/2023/2023-07-19-model-examples.drawio
- A tool that can help populate an initial set of SBOM can help user get started. And not end up with a huge SBOM file.

### Gap analysis for SBOM tool
- We further discuss about tools. Some wonder about existence of a tool to generate AI BOM.
- Karen mentions about the need for a gap analysis for tools.

### Others
- Maybe have a look at AISBOM - AI Software Bill of Materials https://github.com/aai-institute/AI-SBOM
- Track Action Item
