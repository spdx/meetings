### Discussion
- Welcome new members
- EU AI Act: data original purpose, model intended task, and system intended purpose https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/653

## Notes
- Issue 651: PR #656 already approved by Gary. No objection from the meeting. Wait to be merged.
- Issue 657: Arthit points out the mentioned of two different names `Dataset` and `DatasetPackage` for the same class in Dataset Profile. Arun expressed that DatasetPackage is more consistent with AIPackage. Gopi added a comments on the consensus to rename Dataset class to DatasetPackage to the issue.
- Mark mentioned that examples of SBOM using AI Profile for Llama, etc will help us demonstrate the Profile better.
- On EU AI Act gap analysis:
  - The current two proposals for 3.1 (Risk levels https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/650 and Intended purpose https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/653 ) are rather long, the group need time to read and will discuss later.

  - Mark's general suggestion is to create a full profile for each major piece of national or supernational legislation, starting first with the EU AI Act. In each such profile, use that regulator's own terminology, use their own ontology, use their national language. Then evolve tools and suggested practices to translate to and from the more general and generally sane SPDX AI profile, leaving mismatches, changes in concept, and region specific worries up to customers and regulators, and keep the SPDX commitees out of it as much as possible.
  - The meeting agree that we don't aim to close the gap with a specific regulation 100%. We're looking for a generic profile.
  - Mark suggested we need use cases. Arthit suggested three scenarios (based on EU AI Act requirements/obligations):
    - 1) To register an AI system into EU AI database
    - 2) To get the EU declaration of conformity
    - 3) To apply for testing inside regulatory sandbox
    - These three scenarios should give us an idea of what information items we need in the SBOM.
  - For ontology, Arthit mentioned DPV which is another effort ongoing for AI compliance concepts https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/126
  - Arun shows interest to contribute to the gap analysis
  - Arthit to adjust the gap analysis spread sheet to better show the SPDX coverage
