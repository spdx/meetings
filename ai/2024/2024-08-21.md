## Notes

- Arun presented a paper on GenAI (Generative AI Design Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide | by Vincent Koc | Towards Data Science - https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-ai-design-patterns-a-comprehensive-guide-41425a40d7d0)
- Different data flows shown, better to understand what needs to be documented
-  How training data can be stored
- use examples in this paper, and mock up in AI BOM 
- How training process might be a gap in AI-BOM (look at knowledge graphs and tools)
- each model will be fine tuned
- extract the building blocks from this paper (action item)
  - Need to better understand the services new profile
- Search Engines (Keywords, Embeddings/Vectors, Hybrid, Semantic)
- Vector Databases
- Models
- Original data sources (not vectorized) - storages, databases, websites, files, etc.
- Integration with webapps, and other no-code/low-code pieces (e.g. Copilot)
- Kate is focused on hardware, ai and dataset and functional security system, Gary is leading the services
- AI organization (group in Germany) is looking at what's needed in AI-BOM
- They created a json AI-BOM (base line)  hosted on huggingface and github
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model/Core/Vocabularies/AnnotationType.md
