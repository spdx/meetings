## Notes
- Helen started the discussion about tools to populate information in AI and Data Profiles' fields
  - Karen mentioned that there're 2 non-open-source tools that she awared of
    that can automatically populate a lot of information related to AI BOM
  - Gopi and Arthit mentioned that a lot of information for AI and Data Profiles need human
    intervention and information can come from many teams along the development process,
    so it can be a challenge to automatically populate all of the information for the fields
- Discussion about AI BOM in medical device domain
  - Karen and Joseph mentioned a tool from Medcrypt and Vigilant Ops
