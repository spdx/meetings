## Minutes
* Waiting to see if Nick can get example, and then apply https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/15/eu-ai-act.html
* Kate working on diagrams,  Karen willing to help. 
* Sara suggests looking at eLutherAI (https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI)  for training and evaluation scripts instead of/in addition to  RoBERTa
   * Suggestion sent to her -  I think you can bring up that the models by EleutherAI (this is a research group that does open source stuff) usually have not only the model cards but even the training and evaluation scripts open sourced.  so I guess the EleutherAI models could be a study where you have the most information possible on a model. I think anything besides theirs or maybe Bloom will have less information available"
    * RoBERTa was perceived as simpler,  which would be a good contrast.
* Kate showed pictures on how it's happening for Safety,  agreement from others that pictures will be useful for illustration.    Karen interested in helping.   Kate will set up time on Friday. 
* Showing "key fields" indicating from talk - Karen saw a talk that should flag fields "yellow" or "red" - determine if real issue, that needs to be further manually. 
* What is in the next release of dataset & AI profiles?
   * Licenses used for AI purposes.
