## Notes
### New Members
* Matthew Crawford from Arm.   Saw AI profile in BIlbao, and want to learn more/contribute.

### Round Table
* Ambarish asking about the Landscape, and what it's trying for. 

### Licensing Landscape
* Looking at open data sets, and picking off the ones that are accessible.
* Filling in information found,   licenses they are under.    
* Several are custom or no license specified, and there are going to be problematic use of all the data. 
* Looking to have examples from the table.
* Discussion about the generation of licenses needs to start.
* Others are welcome to add in ones they come across.
* Stanford is starting track this as well,  so may be worth working with them to get consolidated list. 
* For 3.1 the LLM data sets are going to be needing more fields.  
* Karen to give access to Steve Winslow & Jilayne Lovejoy.   Luis Villa from Tidelift may have some data points to contribute. 
* Tesla licensing issues as well. 
* Looking for some of this work to kick start the OpenDataology efforts.
* Arthit points out “These include drawing up technical documentation, complying with EU copyright law and disseminating detailed summaries about the content used for training.” https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai,  also For LLM data license that is not in https://spdx.org/licenses/ yet — one is RAIL license.  It is something Open Access with Exceptions (restricts that Anything that violates laws and regulations or Exploit or harm minors) https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license
* Victor I have been reading this new paper: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-2e2023.pdf

### SPDX 3.0
* Walked through the current fields in https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model%20Dataset.png and https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model%20AI.png
* Punchlist 
   * we have Standards (in core) & ComplianceStandard (in AI) - is this redundant?  Need to clarify this at a minimum. 
   * Datatypes & Data  Enumerations - add in "other" category.
   * More examples in text are needed. 
   * Review if any fields from prior discussions are missing
   
###  Admin
