* Daniel provided update on Manifest, they are creating an automated sbom generator for AI applications ie.  - sharing of AI created SBOM, future meeting will provide additional fields that can be added to Ai & Datset profile

* Gopi, what kind of risks that need to be captured in SBOM, categories of risks are the same as regular model/data, but different is end users use prompting which  is a new attack vector.  Don't know how to track these types of issue of prompt injection attacks is a new risk with LLMs, Gopi mentioned that might be similar to SQL injections
