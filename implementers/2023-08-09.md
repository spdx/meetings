# SPDX Implementers Team Meeting - August 9, 2023

## Attendees
* Rose Judge
* Gary O'Neall
* Keith Zantow
* Nisha Kumar
* Dick Brooks
* Adolfo Garcia

## Agenda
* New SBOM tool: https://github.com/bom-squad/protobom

## Notes
### Protobom discussion
* https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/can-protobom-end-the-sbom-format-wars
* Syft can do SPDX to CDX conversion currently
  * syft convert <file> -o cyclonedx-json 
* CDX <--> SPDX is lossy, there's no way around it
  * Particuarly with relationships - CDX only has "contains"
* Main request behind tool creation: we need an SBOM translator
* Architecture: the end goal is an SBOM format translator, but we want a library that can read and write the SBOM data as closely and losslessly as possible
  * Whenever you are working with an SBOM you don't have to worry about reading/writing you just serialize it.
  * bom-shell: query SBOM data in conjunction with protobom
    * https://github.com/chainguard-dev/bomshell
* The goal is to use this project as a library
* Internal data model struct that converts to formats
* In order to use this protobom library, tools will have to convert to the protobom data model and then it will convert to CDX/SPDX
  * Could be lossy if not careful because we're adding another translation
* Syft has it's own internal data model that then maps to the formats, as does Tern
* There's always going to be loss of data because the metadata a package keeps track of isn't always required in an SBOM and vice versa
* Protobom is scoped to the BOM portion of the formats (i.e. no vulnerabilities, VEX)
* Written in go - no much interfacing for other programming languages. Implementers using java or python are left behind with these libraries.
  * This is true no matter the language
* Protobuf is language neutral data model. 

### JSON-LD
* Nisha has a request for a JSON-LD document
  * Hopefully Armin can help with this when he returns from vacation
