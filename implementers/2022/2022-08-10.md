## Agenda
* (No previous agenda items)

## Notes

* Marc-Etienne: SPDX 2.3 is now available for review! ([markdown](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v2.3/chapters) | [json schema](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json))
* ### Nisha: Let's restart the [SPDX Generator](https://github.com/opensbom-generator/spdx-sbom-generator) project!
    * Adolfo: Should we concentrate on the [spdx/tools-golang](https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang)?
    * Nisha is taking over the project, some engineers will be working on the Java generators. Will go over the project this weekend to check what is missing.
    * Part of the motivation is that there aren't any tools that generate "compatible" SPDX 3.0-ish SBOMs so far.
    * Nisha will try to poke the current mantainers and start running community meetings.
    * Announcements will go on the SPDX mailing list, OpenSSF and Twitter
    * We will try to setup a common Document model which hopefully can be shared between tools.
    * We will try to sync efforts between the [SPDX Generator](https://github.com/opensbom-generator/spdx-sbom-generator), [bom](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/bom) (and it's cousins [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) and [apko](http://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko)) and the [SPDX/tools-golang](https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang) to share models, package interpreters and as much code as possible.
    * Consensus that the document models should live in spdx/golang-tools, we will seek approval from the SPDX community.
    * Considerations around making the [Tern command library](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/blob/main/tern/analyze/default/command_lib/base.yml) more visible to reuse its recipes in common projects
    * #### Action Items
        * Nisha will set up new meetings for the Generator project and will notify the SPDX community.
        * Adolfo will set up a meeting with the SPDX tools-golang maintainers.
        * Adolfo will set up a meeting with Brandon Lum to chat about integrating models and where things should live.
        * Adolfo will work on the bom 2.3 document model.
