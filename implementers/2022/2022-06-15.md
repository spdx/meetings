* https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/185
* Approved

### 2.3 Schemas
* Schemas available for review: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/716

### Tooling Updates for SPDX 2.3
* Are folks planning to support 2.2 AND 2.3?
* Adolfo: Kubernetes BOM tool will switch all generation to 2.3; consumption will be 2.2 and 2.3 (still need to run information survey of the users)
* Thomas: ORT will support 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0 but only for JSON and YAML
    * https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/issues/5445
* Tern plans to update to 2.3
   * Marc-Etienne: would prefer flag to generate in 2.2 in case ISO standard 2.2 required
* SPDX Tools: 2.0-2.3 and 3.0 for all the formats
   * SPDX Tools pick up which version to validate against from the SPDX version field in the document
* Gary: waiting for ORT to review schema (JSON + OWL/RDF) before merge; schema review is manual process subject to error
* Gary: RC will be published followed by 2 weeks of review and if there are no significant changes then we will call it done. Once schema has been reviewed then tools can start implementations.

### Volunteer to run this call for a few months this summer?
* Rose will be out on maternity leave starting early July.
* Adolfo offered to host the meeting until Rose returns (likely mid-September)
