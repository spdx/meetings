# SPDX Implementers Team Meeting - 10 January, 2023

## Attendees
* Gary O'Neall
* Nisha Kumar
* Marc-Etienne Vargenau
* Max Huber
* Joshua Watt

## Agenda
* Approve meeting minutes from last week

## Notes
### Code generation using Jinja
* Found some support for Go JSON-LD parsers
* Investigate Joshua's generator for other languages: https://github.com/JPEWdev/shacl2code
  * Implements Ninja scripts - can be used to generate other languages

### Language ecosystem parsers
* Two different sets of use cases:
    * Internal - generating SPDX for code you have control over
    * External - generating SPDX for code you've gathered - e.g. doing a vulnerability scan with SPDX as the intermediate format
* For Internal - work on the native language ecosystems - plugins if possible
  * within a given language ecosystem, you would just download and execute code provided by SPDX or, ideally, supported directly by the community (e.g. NPM)
  * Revive the list of ecosystems and see what's next
  * May not be possible to plug into build ecosystem - examples, Python, Go
    * May be possible to add something after the fact like https://pypi.org/project/python-inspector/ for python
* For external - use existing systems - ORT and Syft
* Can use NexB's inspectors to create data used to generate SPDX files
  * Follow-up with Philippe to strategize - cover in FOSSDEM
