  - Action items for closing on the XML conversion is published
  - Decided to do the next license list update around the end of Oct.
    which will use the new XML file format

## Cross Functional Topics - Gary

  - Discussion on whether the new XML license master list format is
    intended for external tools or to be used internal only to the Legal
    Team in producing the license list
      - Gary recalled a discussion where we decided the first release of
        the XML format would be internal only
      - Consensus that one of the overall goal of the XML format is to
        enable better tooling - the issue is only related to the phasing
        of the XML format implementation
      - Some of the issues to external tool use would be the
        inconsistency in the element and property names with the SPDX
        specification
      - Request that the technical team be involved if the XML format is
        to be used externally
      - Will be discussed on the legal call
