## Mini presentations: New profiles/concepts to be added for 3.1
### Functional Safety (Nicole Pappler)
- New classes for types of documentation needed for functional safety
- New specification class (also used by hardware class)
- New requirement class (from Element)
- New evidence class to capture test results, release approval etc.
- Meetings Friday at 9am Pacific
- [Functional Safety Update Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MGTEMEP9lFf-7pB3Z8kGGpGpVDB-d6BjZstotzZ2a-M/edit?usp=sharing)

### Hardware Profile (Alfred Strauch)
- Includes a supply chain and the work related to this profile is complete for a first round draft
- Meet on Friday mornings at 8am central US time
- Will include a significant upgrade to core profile as well
- Can model any type of hardware (chip, computer, devices, etc)
- Designed to have a decomposition; can take any element and can be decomposed into other elements - packages, bundles  
- Can represent physical hardware, virtual hardware
- Captures physical location (i.e. a fab) and working on virtual location representation
- Significant integration of software so hardware can be mapped to software elements
- Hardware branch in the model

### Operations profile (Marcel Kurzmann)
- A lot of overlap between hardware and operations
- Defines fields for describing the business context of the system that cannot be extracted from the source repo
- Business operations and technical operations
- We need a common language to describe operations for alignment of tool and infrastructure interfaces
- Working on export control assessments for 3.1
- Meet every friday at 1400 UTC. There is also a slack channel
- PR for the operations changes will be opened soon and presented at the tech call (date TBD)
- Steve Winslow – Operations profile and Legal team should sync to discuss in-scope vs. out-of-scope topics

### Threat Modeling (Karsten Klein)
- Discussion in tech call yesterday: How can we model threats with SPDX
- This is not a new profile - Will try to connect this to the security and FuSA profiles

### Cryptography Working group (Agustin Benito Bethencourt)
- This is a new effort, that started two months ago
- List for referencing cryptographic algorithms in SPDX
- Similar to the SPDX license list but for crypto algorithms
- There is a first draft of 122 algorithms structured in 3 categories (classes): cryptographic-hash algorithm, symmetric-key algorithm and, asymmetric-key algorithm
- The first draft of the properties description is being reviewed in the GitHub repo
- Meetings: Wednesdays at 14:00 UTC
- Repository: [https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms)
- Call for participation. We welcome people with use cases in mind to help us shape the list. Also cryptographers to increase the overall knowledge of the current group on this field.

### Concept: Adding component to the model
- New class called component that is a generalization of an SPDX package
- Common info about a package instead of specific version
- Example: openssl
- Benefit: saves a ton of space because avoids redundant packages
- Current PR: [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1044](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1044)
- Can we not do this today? We can but it is ambiguous - not a concrete definition between producers

## Technical Team Report 
### Core & Software
- Trying to understand where there is overlap in the new profiles being added for 3.1
- Targeting release candidate soon - two priorities:
  - Optimizing for hardware profile
  - If any changes to core or software from other new profiles, those are also included.
- Expect multiple release candidates
- Tech and Legal joint meeting to try to advance longstanding issues:
  - License expression syntax for NONE and NOASSERTION identifiers: [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/49](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/49); [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/50](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/50)
    - Trying to figure out if it makes sense to make them available in compound license statements
    - Can be included in complex license combinations via the RDF model in 3.0, but not currently expressible as valid under the license expression syntax
    - Discussed a few use cases where NONE and NOASSERTION can make sense in AND license expressions
    - Next steps: Alexios will update issues to describe where we landed
  - Discussion on capturing metadata about licenses related to one another
    - [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/13](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/13)
    - Discussions on that moved to the license list xml repo: [https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/2805](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/2805)

### Security
- Currently discussing the addition of signatures to the model
  - [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1065](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1065)
- Meetings are happening Tuesdays at 11 AM Pacific
