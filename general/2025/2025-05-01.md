## Presentation
### Discover Dependency License Information Using SBOMs and ClearlyDefined
- Presenter: Jeff Mendoza (GUAC, ClearlyDefined)
- SBOM Legal Compliance: complying with the license of the software (license and attribution information)  
- SBOM Creation tool: dependency detection, identification, hierarchy; Jack of all trades, uses package manager reported license or skips it - license info is afterthought compared to dependency detection
- Maybe there can be tools that specialize in certain information and we combine the outputs of tools  
- ScanCode: reads all files of a package looking for legal text; provides detailed scan data but can take a while to run  
- ClearlyDefined: data project where the data output from other scanners can be shared among OSPOs or anyone else doing legal compliance.   
- SPDX Declared license would be collected by ClearlyDefined  
- ClearlyDefined's documentation: [https://docs.clearlydefined.io/](https://docs.clearlydefined.io/)  
- Harvesting \- trigger clearly defined to scan a package that is new to CD  
- More info on coordinates: [https://docs.clearlydefined.io/docs/resources/coordinates](https://docs.clearlydefined.io/docs/resources/coordinates)  
- Tools created by Jeff to enhance SBOMs: [https://github.com/jeffmendoza/cdsbom](https://github.com/jeffmendoza/cdsbom)  
- How to use clearly defined with SBOMs?  
  - Translation library based on GUAC: [https://github.com/guacsec/sw-id-core/tree/main/coordinates](https://github.com/guacsec/sw-id-core/tree/main/coordinates)   
  - CD doesn’t use PURLs but there is a library that translates coordinates to purl  
- Link to the GUAC project, from where you can also use ClearlyDefined: [https://guac.sh/](https://guac.sh/)
- We have weekly meetings: [schedule and info](https://docs.clearlydefined.io/docs/community/meetings)
- Demo  
- Questions:  
  - Does ClearlyDefined support public Maven repositories other than the 3 listed in the docs? This is a fairly important requirement in the Maven / JVM ecosystem.  
    - To check this, please go to: [https://clearlydefined.io/](https://clearlydefined.io/) and select MavenCentral as the provider.   
  - I have tried a few SBOMs with cdsbom but haven't had a successful run yet -- does that mean ClearlyDefined just doesn't have those components? I have tried a few SBOMs with cdsbom but haven't had a successful run yet -- does that mean ClearlyDefined just doesn't have those components?   
  - What happens when there are differing interpretations of a license for a package?  
    - Debate happens via PR; Curation meeting happens between the curators  
  - Also, feel free to drop an email: [nick.vidal@opensource.org](mailto:nick.vidal@opensource.org), [jlm@jlm.name](mailto:jlm@jlm.name)

## Team Updates
### Core/Software
- Most discussions around rationalizing changes from some of the different profiles (i.e. geography is a field we have added to several profiles under development)  
- Joint call tomorrow between operations and hardware profiles  
- Safety and hardware also overlap  
  - Hardware https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/977  
- SaaS profile ready to merge  
  - SaaS https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/973  
- PR from Alexios to refer to the fact that software hash id is now an iso standard \- can we accept that into 3.0.1 or will it cause issues?  
  - Bob: This can be considered as “editorial”. It points to the same document (as a “progress”).  
- Interest picking up in Europe wrt CRA

### Licensing Profile
- Joint legal and tech call coming to discuss NOASSERTION / NONE in the license expression syntax; will also review whether to address other past / pending topics

### Lite Profile
- No update

### Build Profile
- No update

### Operations Team - Matthew/Marcel/Ummo
- Joint call tomorrow between operations and hardware profiles to resolve conflicts in core

### AI / Dataset Profiles Team - Karen/Gopi
- Karen, Gopi and Kate met last week  
- Work ongoing for 3.1 foundation classes as well as new ideas coming in from AI side
- Prototyping work happening, more stuff added soon
- Tool to generate AI and Dataset Profile from github, documentation, etc information

### Security - Rose
- 3 month sprint of meetings to address some of the issues that are open
- [Doodle poll (now closed)](https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/azYBpDZe?authToken=cm9zZS5qdWRnZUBicm9hZGNvbS5jb207Um9zZSBKdWRnZQ%3D%3D.rEX1qPYVdNPLIbXqc0)
- SPDX Cryptographic List meeting next week [(More info here)](https://lists.spdx.org/g/spdx/message/1983)

### Hardware
- Working on cases with the hardware and AI group  
- One part from Hardware that overlaps with few Profiles is the "Specification" - Specification/Standard/Regulation

### Implementors - Gary
- SPDX Organization at [PyPI (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/org/spdx/)

### Legal team update
- Next release 3.27 coming up in the next week or so

### Outreach - Robert
- OMG published SPDX 3.0 [https://www.omg.org/spec/SPDX/3.0/](https://www.omg.org/spec/SPDX/3.0/) 

### Functional Safety - Nicole/Kate
- Deconflicting work with hardware happening right now
- Concepts of requirements, evidence and tasks overlapping
- PRs coming up

### Software as a Service - Gary
- Ready for merge

## General announcement
- Kate presented on SBOMs and ongoing work on why we need them to the academic community: academics don’t understand that SPDX is a language.
- Tesla keeps a digital twin of every car they sell – info for a system BOM
- Kate’s slides will be published in the next week or so
- New release for the Java tools: it’s official now
- SBOM datasets (could be used for SPDX tests?):
  - [A Dataset of Software Bill of Materials for Evaluating SBOM Consumption Tools Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/14233415)
    - Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06880](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06880)
  - Focus on Java/Maven projects, SPDX Lite -- [Wild SBOMs: a Large-scale Dataset of Software Bills of Materials from Public Code Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/14250103)
    - Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15021) Has a stat of SBOM standards and formats found on public code (Software Heritage Archive)

### Next meeting
- June 5, 2025
