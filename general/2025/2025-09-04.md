### General Updates
- [CISA Requests Public Comment for Updated Guidance on Software Bill of Materials](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/08/22/cisa-requests-public-comment-updated-guidance-software-bill-materials#:~:text=the%20.gov%20website.-,CISA%20Requests%20Public%20Comment%20for%20Updated%20Guidance%20on%20Software%20Bill,and%20this%20Privacy%20&%20Use%20policy)
  - CISA stakeholders have been discussing a revised minimum set of SBOM elements
  - SPDX has the opportunity to give feedback about the changes they’re making and what implications it may have
  - Will discuss feedback in the tech call
- Harmonization between CISA and CRA?
  - ["NSA, CISA, and Others Release a Shared Vision of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)"](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/4292020/nsa-cisa-and-others-release-a-shared-vision-of-software-bill-of-materials-sbom/)
- We will use next Tuesday’s tech call to go through the document and start to draft some feedback. Is there anyone that would like to participate that cannot make next Tuesday's meeting?
  - Will send out response drafted by the tech call to the tech team before steering committee signs off
  - RFC deadline is October 3rd
- [Presentation from CISA at OSS EU](https://osseu2025.sched.com/event/25Vq6/sometimes-sequels-are-good-cisas-update-to-the-2021-ntia-sbom-minimum-elements-victoria-ontiveros-cisa)
- Need Supply Chain Profile logo - Rose will open a ticket with LF
- Any SPDX “news” please send to Phil so we can update the website

### Core & Software
- Split the hardware profile into supply chain profile and hardware profile
  - Pull request is available but hardware hasn’t been moved to the development branch
- Component element (for software profile): grouping of packages so that you can refer to general packages. Can use relationships to connect it to other packages
- ISO submission
- Threat modeling → threat and controls

### Security
- Draft proposal for how to handle signing in the security mailing list

### Licensing
- Adding NONE and NOASSERTION to the license annex and syntax - merged into repo

### Build
- No updates

### Lite
- No updates

### AI
- Reviewing new fields for 3.1

### Dataset
- No updates

### Functional Safety
- Finalizing fields for the release candidate

### Canonicalization/Serialization
- No updates

### Software as a Service
- No updates

### Hardware
- Looking at next phases and what additional elements need to be added.
- Hardware and supply chain will meet together - Fridays 9am EST

### Tooling and Implementers
- Trying to get work going again on the python libraries
- Black Duck version 2025.7.0 now supports SPDX import and export in 3.0.

### Cryptography
- First [draft of the list](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms) completed. 122 crypto algorithms
  - The [properties description PR](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/pull/15) associated to the current version of the list is under review
- Next steps. Iterating now in several fronts:
  - Making some of the properties more SPDX friendly when several values are possible\[[2](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/issues/17)\]\[[3](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/issues/16)\]
  - Correcting some minor mistakes \[[1](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/issues/18)\]
  - Adding [OID](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/issues/20) as property
- Discussions
  -  [Elliptic Curve](https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/issues/21) as property
- Other points
  - Several conversations at OSS EU 2025 about the list. Most had no clue about it, as expected. One [talk](https://osseu2025.sched.com/event/25Vp2/know-your-crypto-standardizing-and-detecting-crypto-algorithms-the-open-source-way-matias-daloia-scanoss) named the list
  - The list was promoted among openchain tooling group
- The security profile is currently discussing how to utilize this list in their representation of a signature.

### Next meeting
- October 2, 2025
