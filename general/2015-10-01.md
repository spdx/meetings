## searchcode presentation - Nuno Brito

  - Background
      - Has been working with SPDX for two years and it’s been a good
        experience
      - Hard to get engineers to use SPDX with out good examples for
        them to examine
      - seachdcode seemed to be a good solution
  - searchcode
      - Started by a developer in Austrailia
      - Seemed like a great place to make SPDX available
  - Questions / Discussions
      - Interest in having link from SPDX
      - Files seem to have some extra fields so won’t validate
          - Nuno is very open and suggests filing bugs
      - Adoption in Europe
          - Everyone that Nuno is working with is using SPDX
          - He’s found little resistance
          - Some people are more comfortable with tag value, but bigger
            projects are find with RDF
          - Still there is some difficulty for adoption.
