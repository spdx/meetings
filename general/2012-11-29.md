## Special Report on Open Compliance Summit, Japan - Adam

  - Overview
      - End of October. Great Event in General.
      - Surprising amount of awareness/interest in SPDX to help with
        recruitment
      - Adam/Mark Gisi (Windriver) pulled together a come all SPDX info
        meeting to help with recruitment
      - Chatham House rules, so sharing but no attribution of comments
  - Unscheduled Roundtable
      - Pulled together at last minute for end of first day
      - 12 participants (surprisingly high)
      - Lots of interest and awareness. According to Adam, "the concept
        of SPDX sold itself)
      - Continued discussion with a number of participants the next day
  - Flavor of discussion/inquiry
      - Caution/Concern
      - Fear of Unknown
      - Language Issue
      - Fear of obligation- Worry that signing up is somehow a big
        commitment
  - Concerns
      - Language Issue
          - More written materials would really help
          - English is OK (for written stuff) but looking for "User
            Manual" level documentation
          - The language of the Spec itself is difficult for non-English
            speakers
      - Seems Complicated
          - But MarkG was able to make folks understand it's not really
          - So a simple, written explanation would really help
          - Specific interest in understanding mandatory v. optional;
            what's the minimum
          - Kate had similar experience at U of Nebraska - Concern about
            complexity that went away after simple explanation.
          - So, all this is s general issue, but answer for Japan has to
            be written doc due to language.
      - Obligation
          - Concern that if you touch SPDX, you have to overhaul your
            entire compliance operation
          - Need to help folks understand, it's just a format and can
            fit your processes; it's a spec, not a business method
  - Current State
      - A number of companies we didn't even know were aware are
        piloting internally
      - Some of these are not even on any mailing lists
  - How we can help
      - Written, user level doc
      - Help people understand how to dip a toe in
      - Lots of interest in understanding how to be just a consumer
      -
