Ibrahim joined for the first time. He is in charge of technical and
legal initiatives for the Linux Foundation and taken on the role of LF
project coordinator for SPDX. He should be a big help.

## Business Team Report

The panel discussion for LinuxCon will be lead by Scott and will include
Kate, Jilayne and Jack representing respective teams. He's also
recruited Matt Germonprez from U Nebraska to talk about his
FOSSology/SPDX work.

Scott is working with LF on a press release about V1.1 to be released at
LinuxCon.

## Tech Team

Still working 2.0 use cases and trying to wrap up 1.1.

executed).
