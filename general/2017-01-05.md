## Special Presentation- Georgia (Zeta) Kapitsaki

  - Goals of work
      - Automate license specification and selection
      - Helping smaller companies and independent developers
      - Helping with combining licenses
          - Created a graph of compatibility for this purpose
          - Based on analysis by computer scientists (not reviewed by
            lawyers
  - Selected SPDX because it was the only standard way to represent
  - Analysis
      - Use RDF version of SPDX
      - Parse and find the different licenses
      - Based on compability graph to determine whether the license
        combinations are OK
      - Can analyze multiple docs to determine compatibility as well
  - Implementation
      - Based tools on SPDX community tools; implemented Java
      - Started with v1.1; needs upgrading
      - Had a problem with finding real files and so used on line
        FOSSology tools to create
  - Process
      - Uses graph, but graph could be used manually independent of SPDX
      - Find compatible/incompatible licenses
      - Determines problems and flags compatibility problems
  - Available on GitHub
  - Question
      - Are you looking at type of file when analyzing compatibility?
        Make files for example
          - No they analyze all licenses
          - Would be a direction for the future
          - Might also us dependency information
      - How did you determine which files were compatible and
        incompatible
          - Did their own analysis
          - Perhaps allow configuration of compatibility
