## Cross Functional Issues – Phil

  - Great Presentation from Bruno Grasset
  - He opened and closed with thanks to everyone involved with SPDX for
    providing something so useful to the industry
      - Valeo
          - Supplier to Automotive Industry- Autonomous Cars, Connected
            Car, Intuitive Control
          - Middle of complex supply chain
      - Why they think SPDX is important
          - Industry is “likes” standards, procedures, rules
          - Have an explicit program to ensure respecting licenses and
            meeting obligations in all products
          - Bruno is in charge of OSS compliance
      - How they use
          - License List
              - Internal policy started with the SPDX list
              - They use the SPDX license IDs in all of their documents
                and databases (including promoting publicly)
              - And they check any licenses anyone supplies against our
                standard text
          - Document Spec
              - Prototyped use internally
              - Have been looking for hierarchy, so 2.0 is important;
                evaluating in 2015
      - Future Intent
          - Large OEMs (car companies) are starting to require
          - Customer requirements are making this a priority in 2015
          - Will need to require from their own suppliers
          - Integration with Yocto is critical
          - Aiming for chain of trust, based on SPDX
      - Questions
          - When you evaluated SPDX, any features beyond hierarchy that
            they require?
              - Not yet mature enough to completely evaluate
          - How did you hear of? How can we promote?
              - LinuxCon Europe session- Bruno came then promoted
                internally.
              - He expects that in his space that SPDX will catch on
                quickly because of car makers requirements
          - SPDX and Yocto- Is there only interest in Yocto integration
            or more general integration?
              - Broader interest in integrating into process

## General Status - Phil

  - On track for 2.0 release at CollabSummit
  - Jack has been working hard to get a good agenda together

    participate in both
