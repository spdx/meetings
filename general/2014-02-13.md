## Legal Team Report - Jilayne

  - On going
      - Some new license requests
      - Marking up licenses
  - Fedora list resolution is somewhat stalled and needs a jumpstart
  - FOSDEM report
      - There was a presentation on SPDX in the legal track
          - The presenter showed up late
          - Conference organizers were not happy with that and there
            were some issues with content
          - Did not reflect well on SPDX, so we need some quality
            control for conference presence.

  - Phil posted [language describing direction in 2.0 spec section of
    SPDX.org](http://spdx.org/SPDX-specifications/spdx-version-2.0)
  - [License Expression
    Syntax](Legal_Team/License_Expression_Review_1 "wikilink") - MarkG
      - Cross functional effort between Tech and Legal Teams to define
        formal but simple and flexible mechanism for expressing complex
        licensing of some packages (multiple licensing, exceptions, etc)
      - Will essentially use Boolean operators and parentheses.
      - Productive kick off meeting yesterday; agreement on the issue
        and reasonable alignment on the approach
      - One more meeting before Collab Summit with the goal of having a
        draft for discussion at the Summit
