## Technical Team Report - Bill

Good Progress

One specific blocking item/for spec and tools. The issue is has to do
with set of terms to describe situation where a concluded license is not
named. Team had been working with terms such as: None, No Assertion, Not
Analyzed, Blank. They are working on a final proposal but are leaning
towards two values one indcating that there has been a conclusion that
there is no license and one indicating that there is no conclusion one
way or the other.

Team is asking for some ratification from the legal team, but proceeding
on the two value path.

## Business Team Report - Kim

Beta kickoffs are scheduled.

Final field names are getting merged into the training and tool docs by
Kim and Kirsten resepctively.

## Legal Team Report - Rockett

Metadata licensing issue still under discussion

Team is reviewing the need for including change tracking of SPDX docs in
the spec. This will not hold up the beta. There was a discussion about
how major a requirement this would be, i.e. would it necessarily hold up
V1.0 past LinuxCon in August. The general sense from members of the Tech
Team (which has been contemplating the issue) was that it would not by
itself.

## Cross Functional Issues â€“ Phil

Website: A workign group of Kirsten, Pierre and Steve have been
reviewing the website for usability. They are recommending the "three
big buttons" approach to the home page for folks who are:

  - New to SPDX and want to get up to speed
  - Familar and looking for official information on the spec and how to
    use
  - Interested in participating in development of the spec

Their other major recommendation was to have drop down menus to give
more visibility into the various sections of the website from the home
page.

There was lots of spirited discussion and opinions, but general
agreement on the direction.

The team will be developing and circulating mockups for subsequent
feedback.
