  - Spec
      - All known issues are addressed in 2.2
      - Under discussion:
          - Idea of a short format for copyrights ala license IDs from
            FSFE
              - Would be added as an appendix (like license IDs)
              - Could use a joint tech/legal teams call
          - Exploring branching strategy
          - Pared down version, defining minimal subset (from Japan work
            group)
              - Still SPDX compliant as it will utilize mandatory fields
              - Part of the spec
              - Important to communicate that; it’s not a fork
  - Tools
      - GSoC
          - 8 projects total (a record)
          - Great progress, all passed first evaluations
      - Flurry of tooling work with the new license list
          - Better matching/copyright matching
          - License format improvements
