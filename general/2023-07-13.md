## Administrative
* Lead by Rose Judge
* Minutes from last meeting to approve: https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/335
  * Approved

## Presentation about Fedora migration to SPDX IDs - David Cantrell, Richard Fontana and Jilayne Lovejoy
* getfedora.org - community open source OS project sponsored by RedHat; not governed by RH, very much communiy focused
  * Foundation of what eventually becomes RHEL
* Package licensing matters to enable collaboration
* If we improve licensing upstream, it will improve licensing downstream as well
  * Fedora is downstream and upstream
* Where is upstream licensing information found?
  * Source files with license notice or text
  * Text files with license text
  * Project hosting sites
  * Distribution/package managrs provide as metadata
  * There is NO universasl standard
* Challenges 
  * Projects have their own reporting standards
  * Projects group similar licenses together
  * How do you know what policy is being applied?
  * Lack of upstream project coordination (seen as downstream-only concern)
* Fedora uses rpm to package. spec files for rpm packages have a specific "License" field
  * Originally used Fedora's own license short names (pre-SPDX)
  * When SPDX came along, there was a long period of resistance to using external SPDX identifiers
  * Discussion of switching to SPDX license IDs goes back to ~2011
* Previous Fedora system complicated to maintain - lack of consistent documentatino for packagers to follow, no clear owner and past documentation unclear 
* What changes were made?
  * Machine readable data first, documentation second
  * Create easy to use data file format in Gitlab repo
  * Discussion and decisions about licensse approval/classification done in Gitlab issues
  * Community discussion (still) on mailing list
  * Overhauled process for license approval and review (switched to SPDX syntax)
  * SPDX offered a way to talk about licenses in a more precise, defined way
* Migrate to SPDX license expressions
  * Mapping of Fedora legacy short names to SPDX license ids
  * Document process for updating License: field for existing packages
  * Contributions to SPDX (adding missing licenses to the license list)
* Moving forward, the future is bright!
  * Update existing packages efficiently
  * Further improvements to Fedora documentation
  * Incorporate reviewed licenses from Red Hat
  * Additional influence and submissions to on SPDX License List
  * Impact on other communities
* Still tons of work to be done on issues like this
  * May need to refine rules around conventions for how to populate license field
* Questions:
    * Plans to have SPDX BOMs for Fedora? - A: No
    * Adding SPDX to GNU toolchain - recommendations at the granularity of how to include this info in header files? - A: Linux kernel is the best example

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary/WIlliam
