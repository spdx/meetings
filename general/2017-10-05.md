## Guest Presentation - Alexander Lisianoi

  - Background
      - Working on masters in Technical University of Vienna
  - Project
      - Turning Python Code into Javascript
          - Pooling PY and License expression
          - Libraries that are self contained
          - Initially looked easy
      - Results
          - It works\!
      - How it went
          - Long list of tools available, so choosing a tool is the
            first step
              - Brython, Batavia, Transcript
              - Brython can read in pure Python
              - Bytavia uses Python byte code
              - Transcript actually translates to javacode, so he picked
                that one
                  - Downside is that it doesn’t handle every Python
                    capability
          - Encountered a lot of bizarre results
              - And complained a fair amount
              - Tricky to know what goes wrong; have to debug both in
                parallel
              - Errors can be subtle
              - How things are compared differs between languages
      - The resulting tool
          - You can parse, but it can be broken
      - Value of the work
          - Javascript is very commonly used for front ends these days
          - You don’t want to have to support two technologies for front
            and back end
          - This allows leveraging the backend scripts for building
            front end
          - Valuable to tool developers using JS and to development
            communities
          - As a side-effect of the work, we Alexander helped

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary

  - Spec
      - All on GItHub now
  - Last few meetings have been focused on
      - FSF proposal
          - Supporting legal team on expanding license expression
            language
      - Testing work from Jack
          - Tool testing cases
              - Scanners for locating license language
              - License language matchers (using matching guidelines)
          - Also testing license list generator
              - Which requires test cases as well
          - Looking at creating a repo for all test cases
              - Two tool types
              - License list gen
          - Will be community based so folks can contribute cases
  - Preview
      - Looks like there will be a new tool contribution from an LF
        member
      - A tool to create a summary
          - Input SPDX tag value; output easy to read/intrerpret format

<!-- end list -->

  - LinuxCon Europe
      - There will be a meeting for those creating tools
      - New testing work with be on the agenda

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne/Paul

  - FSF Proposal
      - For how the GPL version is represented
      - Questions about new operators, default
      - Generated a large meeting with tech folks
          - Lively discussion
          - Did not reach resolution
      - FSF has come back with another proposal
          - Technical challenges
          - Difference of opinion, particularly for case where
          - Part of the issue is that FSF is focused on just the
            identifiers vs. how we use with SPDX
              - License does not specify “or later” or “only”
              - How do we represent without representing legal judgment
              - Fundamentally there are different opinions on what it
                means when there is no specification
              - Very important to FSF (including Richard Stallman)
