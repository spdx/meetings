  - Background
      - Presented previously at FOSDEM
      - Used Zephyr, lightweight RTOS
      - Goal in parallel with CMake build generate an SPDX file
          - including relationships
          - fully automated
          - not pull from external sources (license data for example)
          - make is Zephyr-agnostic, so could be reusable
  - POC
      - On GHub
      - Used File-based API on CMake
          - to tell CMake to dump JSON meta-data files for each artifact
          - and then build
      - Created SPDX
          - Pull from
              - Sources directory
              - Artifacts directory
              - Pull SPDX short form license names from files
              - Create relationships
          - Output is two files
              - Sources
              - Build artifacts
              - w links between
  - Findings
      - Some limitations to the CMake API data, missing some info that
        CMake seems to “know”
      - Some invalid IDs
      - Graphiz was helpful in visualize the relationships represented
        in JSON files
  - Next Steps
      - Takeaways: the concept basically works; start small and can be
        improved
      - Working w Zephyr community
          - may have made it overly agnostic
          - could tailor to Z build system
          - but generalized version is a great starting point
      - Michael Herzog: developed TraceCode as a tool to similarly look
        at details during the build process; more generalized, but
        extremely hard to use for anything sizeable b/c creates so much
        data
      - Also looked at Yocto as a way to gather this information
      - Kate: Richard Purdie interested in this also from the Yocto side
        – perhaps get together a working group focused on this. Yocto
        also doing work around reproducible builds, and has been
        adopting SPDX identifiers.

 

  -   - Kay: thoughts on a “Build” profile for SPDX 3.0 to incorporate
        build-time data about e.g. the call used to start the
        compilation, the environment / compilation settings, etc. We
        should get various compiler people talking about how to align
        practices for this
      - Kate: agreed, let’s get a working group together on this

 

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne/Paul/Steve

 

  - Gary and William got the license list CI system moved from Travis to
    GitHub Actions – thank you\!
  - 3.12 – aiming to release this weekend; will tie up remaining issues
    in call after this meeting
  - Jilayne and Steve looking at getting some bigger projects going
  - Invite to all to jump into the conversations in issue threads -
    <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues>

 

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary/Others

 

  - Model and Process update – Gary
      - William leading discussions on Base profile model – reconciling
        feedback
      - Template for how to draft and write the profile specifications
  - Google Summer of Code – Gary
      - Should be hearing back shortly whether SPDX was accepted for
        2021

 

  - Spec – Kate
      - Defects / Security – Thomas
          - currently revising what was discussed on prior meetings
          - worked with William on expressing vulnerabilities
          - also looking at: whether / how to express mitigation
            measures
      - Linking – Nisha
          - Sounds like people do want a Linking / Linkage profile
          - Currently described in the spec as an “External Map” from 3T
            discussions, but not sure what this means – looking for more
            details
      - Integrity – Kay
          - Working on creating POC for taking an SBOM, serializing it
            to binary, signing it using the COSI (?) standard
          - could be signed in other ways, but using this for POC b/c
            small format and usable for small devices
          - expect to have this the week after next
          - spec for document integrity – “here’s how you sign SBOMs” –
            after having that as an example, plan to start reviewing
            with broader group
          - may be a month before ready to discuss on a tech team call
      - Usage – Yoshiyuki Ito
          - discussing what info to include in usage profile
          - looking at using external map to refer to external
            information sources
      - Pedigree / Build / Creation – Kate
          - can start those meetings happening, flesh out ideas
          - reach out to in-toto folks to align with them

 

  - SPDX 2.2.1 – Kate:
      - ISO balloting has finished on the specification, via JDF
      - Approved from balloting, so should be getting an ISO number in
        the next few months
      - May have some tweaks to the 2.2.1 repo coming in, based on
        comments from ISO reviewers
