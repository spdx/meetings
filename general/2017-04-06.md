## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary

  - Prepping for Google Summer of Code
      - 10 proposals
      - At least 3 or 4 are very promising, only 1 or 2 that aren’t that
        great
          - Examples:
              - On-line validation tool (already engaged with community)
              - Automating SPDX gen in GitHub (already thought out
                architecture)
              - License grade
      - Mentors lined up for 2-4 slots we’ve requested
      - Will pick appropriate number based on slots

## Outreach Team Report - Jack

  - Creating a developer-friendly area in Git for SPDX
      - Versions of the spec
      - Information exchange
          - following example of nexB creating an umbrella repo for the
            nexB family of repos
  - Talking about what we expect people to do
      - So we can make more definitive statements
      - for different market segments sort of
      - Will guide website

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne

  - XML markup
      - Made some recent decisions
      - Down to less that 60 licenses
      - Still work to do and volunteers needed
  - Reception
      - Seeing interest on GitHub
      - Getting useful feedback on particulars of licenses
  - Challenge
      - Juggling two lists until next release
      - Unclear where to log updates
      - Enduring until next release
      - May make sense to post “Bear with us” message
          - in GitHub
          - and current repo
  - Timing
      - uncertain as it depends on getting the work done
      - plus a week or two of Gary once XML is done
