## Tech Team Report - Kate

  - Team will be using a googledoc as the working copy of the 1.2 spec
      - Contact Kate if you would like to be added to the doc
  - Requirements for 1.2 are stable and are in Bugzilla
  - The goal of releasing 1.2 by LinuxCon looks achievable in the
    absence of any major changes.

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne

  - Main focus is on creating license templates
      - Have been testing
          - It's been a little trial and error with some confusion
          - Jilayne will be puttying out a clarification
      - Daniel German will take formated inputs from legal team and
        implement markups
      - May be complete by LinuxCon
  - Have started looking at the Fedora license list to determine
    coverage

      - Note that there is a bug in Drupal. To download docs, you need
        to be logged in and you need to hit the file cabinet icon all
        the way on the right first, and then download.

## Cross Functional Issues â€“ Phil

  - Web Site Update - Jack
      - Will be adding Blog; Phil will make sure at least one update per
        month
      - Will be adding some pictures; Phil is driving and could use any
        relevant pics.
  - Linux Foundation feedback - Mike Dolan
      - Good interest in SPDX from Yocto and Open Daylight
      - Several member companies have expressed interest in accelerating
        2.0 release
          - We are constrained by Tech Team resources to single
            threading 1.2
          - Mike thinks he may be able to come up with some resources
          - Kate believes that 3-4 more people willing to work outside
            meetings would make a dramatic difference
