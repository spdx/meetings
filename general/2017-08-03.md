## Guest Presentation - Rohit

  - Studying computer science in India
      - Working with SPDX for a number of months
      - Great experience in learning about how open source works
      - And, was surprised to learn about license issues
  - Project- On line SPDX tools
      - move existing tools to web interfaces
      - started with simple UI
          - and, of course, used open source
          - java and python
          - needed a java VM
          - finally found a project that worked for him
  - Three tools
      - Validation tool
      - Converter tool
      - Comparison tool
  - Vailidation Tool
      - Very simple UI
      - Basically just upload a file
      - Returns result of SPDX compatibility errors
      - Works for both tag value and RDF
  - Comparison Tool
      - takes two file inputs (for comparison)
      - after files uploaded, they go through validation
      - If so, they are compared
      - output is Excel sheet, saved on the server, user gets download
        link
  - Conversion Tool
      - conversions between format types
      - user selects type of conversion
      - returns required format
          - similar to spreadsheet, stored on server with download link
  - Next steps
      - creating API so other applications can call
      - benefit is that java tool prereqs don’t need to be called
  - Rohit went through a very short demo but will set up a more detailed
    one with the Tech Team

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary

  - Spec
      - Got through all of the topics in the Google Doc
      - Making good progress
  - 2.2 v 3.0 discussion
      - Still open to input on burning use cases that aren’t covered
      - Please feel free to provide input
      - SPEC URL- <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec>
  - Tooling
      - most of the focus has been on GSoC
          - everyone is making great progress
          - evaluation last week and everyone passed\!
      - Progress on Python libraries
      - Helping legal team with tooling

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne/Paul

  - Uptick in activity on XML review
      - Brad and Alexios have been great
      - This has been a longstanding need, so great to see progress
  - Discussion about Linus’ note on Linux and GPL
      - Will be added to license list
  - On the plate now: Lots of chatter on email list about implications
    of adding “+” operator
      - background
          - used to have two different licenses to handle “only” and “or
            later”
          - now using an operator
          - left “GPL only”
      - It’s created some problems
          - current meaning of GPL-2
          - problems with standard header
      - reached a conclusion about how to handle going forward
      - Best option
          - deprecate plus operator
          - go back to two different licenses
              - doesn’t really apply to other licenses anyway
              - we believe, but still open for discussion
      - big topic on legal call today
  - License comparison tool, web-based
      - <https://certification.openchainproject.org/spdxweb/>
          - URL could change
  - API thought from Phil
      - Assuming we publish APIs for hosted tools, we will need to
        specify terms of use.

## Outreach Team Report - Jack

  - Jack unavailable. His email input:
      - Update from my side is that we are still working on fleshing out
        and documenting the program tools that can scan licenses and
        generate/read spdx documents.
      - Kate- Also talking about how to come up with a test suite for
        tools to make sure tools correctly read/generate SPDX
