  - Attendance: 26
  - Lead by Phil Odence
  - Minutes of Dec meeting Approved

## 3T-SBOM - Kay/Bob

  - Basis
      - To standardize, tools need to talk to each other
      - Developed 9 use cases
      - Started up in 2019; several groups involved
      - Provenance/Pedigree distinction
      - Started w/NTIA fields as basis
      - Developed model very similar to SPDX
      - Started w/ software but can be broader
  - Merging Efforts
      - Common goals/members; working for some time
      - So, made sense to merge
      - Harmonized meetings
          - Profile groups meeting separately from Tech meeting
          - All a little fluid
      - Longer Term thoughts
          - Licensing and contribution agreements for spec
          - User scenarios, broader scope
              - May need to update naming scheme
              - Broader scope may require expanded governance and
                funding
  - Questions
      - Funding discs

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary/Others

  - Spec - Kate
      - Overview
          - SPDX 2.2 being refactored into upcoming 3.0 effort, with
            Core and separate topical Profiles
          - Has been happening in parallel with 3T SBOM efforts
      - Core - William
          - Area with most overlap with 3T efforts
          - Have been working on identifying areas of differences
            between the two, gradually converging
          - Last month was focused on identifying remaining differences
            and working through them, determining how critical they are
          - Remaining differences are centered on (1) naming things and
            (2) external references
          - Also working through tooling and how to document the core
            standard
          - Close to done on what the model will look like, want to turn
            next to actually writing it up in a format that is suitable
            for use cases – transition from modeling to authoring of
            spec text
      - Licensing - Steve
          - Described background of licensing fields combined with
            “core” in 2.2 and prior spec versions
          - Splitting out licensing-related fields into a separate
            optional profile
          - Previously discussed and brainstorming in a shared Google
            Doc
          - Was previously planning to wait on migrating into GitHub
            until spec format was finalized; sounds like that will still
            be some time until finalized
          - Will work on migrating Google Doc brainstorming outcomes
            into GitHub in MarkDown or plain text
      - Defects – Thomas
          - Includes “vulnerabilities”
          - Worked with William on documenting an example
          - Still working on remediation-related fields
          - Hoping to have more concrete examples, and to restart the
            security discussions before the end of this month
      - Linking – Nisha
          - Mockups:
            <https://github.com/SantiagoTorres/spdx-linking-mockups>
          - “Linking” – how different software components are related to
            each other, and to separate components in the broader
            ecosystem
          - Profile aims to capture, if using e.g. a container or a CNAB
            (Cloud Native Application Bundle), meant to surface those
            connections
          - Focused on cloud native use case, but could also be used in
            e.g. the embedded world, for something like an embedded OS
            utilizing multiple components
              - Kay – other scenarios thinking about: e.g. IoT devices,
                wanting to list out both software and hardware
                components
              - Santiago – working on similar for in-toto, to
                authenticate components
          - Currently stuck on sorting out the overlap between the
            Linking profile and the Integrity profile. Current thinking,
            integrity signatures should be handled via “relationships”
            between elements
      - Integrity – Santiago
          - Slides: \[TO BE FILLED IN\]
          - There are a lot of outstanding questions, still being sorted
            through
          - Milestone structure: Document integrity \>\> Document
            Authentication \>\> Document & supply chain policy \>\>
            Linkage & supply chain integrity
          - Discussed roles of each stage and current status of
            milestones
      - Usage and Other Emerging – Kate
          - Spearheaded by team in Japan
          - Looking at carrying e.g. contract info along in SPDX
            documents
          - Also looking at Pedigree / Provenance profiles, for fields
            to carry build information
  - Tools and Google Summer of Code (GSoC) - Gary
      -  GSoC: Applications open for projects, Gary is applying now,
        will update next month
      - Will post link to project page
      - Looking at different tooling for supporting spec process
