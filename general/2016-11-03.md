## Special Guest - Lei Mao Hui, Fujitsu

  - Lei
      - Working for Fujitu
      - Developing on house Distro
      - Spoke at ALS and Linux Conference about experience with SPDXX

<!-- end list -->

  - Reason Fujitsu needs SPDX
      - Want an SPDX file for all their packages
      - Customers ofter require license info
      - Released under GPL3, but includes software under other license
        as well. Many\!
          - MIT, BSD, GPL2, etc.
      - SPDX is good for this purpose
      - So they added into production Development

<!-- end list -->

  - Yocto SPDX
      - Lucky for them that Yocto supports SPDX
      - But the activity on Yocto SPDX has been slow
      - Found some issues when using
          - Only supports SPDX 1.1
          - Doesn’t do a great job even with that
          - Is complex to use; takes a long time
          - May introduce license conflicts
      - In the end you can download the SPDX

<!-- end list -->

  - Fujitsu’s contributions to Yocto SPDX
      - So they did some work to improve:
          - Created a patch to upgrade to SPDX 1.2
              - Unfortunately was never accepted into Yocto
      - Would like to upgrade to SPDX 2.0
      - And to improve performance
      - Has been working on some of the SPDX open source tools
          - including DoSocks developed by UNO
      - Lei has been continuing to submit improvements to Yocto
          - Improved performance
      - Currently discussing more improvements with Yocto
      - Will be continuing to improve and to upgrade to SPDX 2.1

<!-- end list -->

  - Question
      - Has yocto been receptive?
          - Yocto has not been active or focused on SPDX.
          - Some people have been interested
          - Not sure why they are not interested
      - Kate will help and follow up
