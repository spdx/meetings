  - Umang
      - License submittal workflow automation
          - Aim is to enhance user experience
          - Compare submitted text against existing licenses to see if
            there’s duplication or close match
          - Problems he’s trying address
              - What if the license is on the list, proposed,
                rejected…or a close match to one of those
              - Current XML formatting- word-wrap doesn’t match license
          - Also creating/documenting an API
      - Tasks:
          - Create API- use without logging in, so can be accessed by
            other tools
          - Create License Matcher- looks for exact and close matches
              - Returns all matches and close matches
          - Compare with not accepted as well as rejected licenses.
              - Reports appropriately according to match
              - Relies on user input regarding whether to go ahead with
                submittal
          - Improve formatting of generated license
      - Screenshots available at:
        <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NMcLZVXxBV2PZobPJh1OugbCfC2d8kbAOX4m4TauEYk/edit?usp=sharing>
      - Some discussion of how the workflow should work with close
        matches
      - Aiming for demo in future Legal Team meeting

<!-- end list -->

  - Tanjong
      - License namespace
          - A way to name valid licenses outside of the License List
          - Created namespace and UI
          - Also a mechanism for turning into a license request
          - Took feedback from the joint/legal team meeting

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary

  - Spec
      - Progress on Appendix for including other fields in the source
        like the license ID
          - Worked with Legal team members and general agreement to keep
            scope at file level
          - Recommend using existing Tags with SPDX prefix, and
            expectation that format follows fields.
          - Motivation is that this makes it easier for tools to pick up
            data accurately from source.
      - SPDX document generation from project sources (demo'd last
        month)
          - Philip is looking for projects to try the tool on, if you
            have some you want to experiment with, please contact him.
  - Tools
      - GSoC
          - Continues to go very well
          - All students passed second evaluation
      - Looking for feedback from community:
          - License matching algorithm approaches
              - Some encoded rules
              - Some depended on XML markup
              - Should we encode in XML or handle programmatically?
                (Discuss with Gary)
