## Guest Speaker- Allan Friedman, NTIA

  - NTIA’s Multistakeholder SBOM Process
      - Concerns about software supply chain risks have garnered more
        attention and energy in the OSS community, industry, and
        governments around the world. One natural starting point is a
        greater expectation of transparency of software components and
        dependencies. Any solution must scale up and down the software
        supply chain, and across the incredibly diverse software
        ecosystem, from modern CI/CD application development to critical
        infrastructure and embedded systems. Over the past two years,
        NTIA has helped a diverse set of stakeholders find a common
        vision for a "software bill of materials" (SBOM) that has the
        potential to scale as needed, and serve as a foundation for even
        more innovation around software supply chain security and
        quality. The SPDX community has played a key role in this
        discussion, and emerged as a key standard. This presentation
        will give an overview of the policy landscape, the progress
        made, and the work yet to be done around SBOM.
