## Special Guest - Sam Ellis, ARM

  - Sam works in ARM’s Cambridge HQ
      - SW Engineer/Mgr
      - No legal training
      - Has gotten involved just as part as his job
      - Now acts as bridge between dev and legal teams
  - They use a license scanning tool
      - That’s the implementation of SPDX
      - Keen on the license list for name consistency
      - And using SPDX basis of repository of data about open source in
        products
  - Dev process
      - Similar to most
      - Are careful to separate out open source archive
          - Basis of license scanning
          - Develop an SPDX tag format report for each product
  - Legal Approval Process
      - They use a custom tool internally
      - When open source comes into the company, they assess risk
      - Recently put a new system in place
          - Asks the type of questions that SPDX captures
              - Package name, licenses, copyright notices, where
                downloaded, etc.
          - Goal is to to eventually import/export SPDX for this
            purposes
      - Tracks OSS use cases
  - Two systems using
      - Approval process
      - Data from the build
      - Will eventually try to compare to ensure sync
          - Can be hard to maintain, particularly when removing stuff.
  - Sam’s projects use and exceptionally large amount of OSS
      - Need to explain to customers
      - Ideally would like to auto-gen the list of licenses they publish
          - Practical Problem: They don’t want to declare all
              - For example, disjunctive license, may only want declare
                one
  - Would like to ship SPDX
      - Need to work out how much to declare
      - They get a lot of queries
          - Concern is does providing more info, generate more queries
      - \* Certainly they feel that SPDX is the right format
  - Observations
      - Tag file is large - 130 MB for one product
          - Too large to ship, but could include on website
          - Too much info to be comprehensible
      - People who need to use, don’t have the tools
          - Need something that can open and filter/summarize
  - Learning
      - In the past have developed one big SPDX file
      - Probably a mistake, should have broken it down
  - Discussion
      - Tooling- perhaps the convertor to spreadsheet
      - Supply chain partners are really interested in use cases, not
        just what’s in product
      - Any sharing SPDX docs within company yet? - No, not yet.
