## Special Guest - Dave Marr, Qualcomm

  - SPDX is a critical piece of getting well and getting good at
    managing open source
  - Open source overall
      - Requires cross functional participation
      - Some very intellectual interesting aspects
      - Management
          - really requires a lot of uninteresting, rote work
          - Necessary to get it right
      - Opportunity for automation
          - Requires standard practices
              - Open Chain
              - SPDX
              - SIPOC model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPOC)
          - Customer focus required
              - Focus on internal customers too, requires mindset shift
              - Delivering code with compliance problems is like
                delivering bad code
              - Qualcomm engineers all take Dave’s training
                  - The more specific instructions the better
          - SPDX connection
              - Information must be in a factorable form
              - Standardization is key
          - Process required to yield the output
              - That’s the hard part
              - Can’t have drag on engineering processes
              - So need automation and “plumbing”
          - Direction
              - Aiming for seamlessness
              - Suppliers need to be brought into this
              - If everyone provides SPDX, there’s still the need to
                efficiently consume and manage through the dev process
              - Solution needs to handle version control and compilation
              - The dream is a way to move the SPDX files along with the
                code and to handle refactoring to the ultimately the
                SPDX files for products the ship are available and
                largely accurate.
          - How to get there?
              - Tricky to improve the plane while still flying
          - Does annotation in SPDX help?
              - So far they struggle with achieving behavioral change in
                engineering
              - Works best when product managers drive
              - Annotations are good for simple use case
          - Looking at hooks into version control systems?
              - Yes, and this might be the ultimate approach
              - At least part of the solution
              - One source of truth is required -- and as contained
                within the version control system

## Tech Team Report - Kate

  - Spec
      - 2.1 very close to getting pushed out
          - two appendices need a little work, but that’s it
          - Kate can provide link to review for everyone
          - Somewhat waiting for Gary’s return from vaca
      - Live on the new website
  - Tools
      - Starting to update for 2.1

## Outreach Team Report - Jack

  - Website
      - Still working it through
      - Lots to talk about in team call today
      - Still a few functional issues, need to resolve with LF folks

## Legal Team Report - Paul

  - Primary focus getting all the licenses into GitHub
      -   - for maintenance
          - and more future utility
    
      - all license have been converted
        
          - going thru manually
  - New licenses
      - knocking them down as they come in
      - little backlog at this point
