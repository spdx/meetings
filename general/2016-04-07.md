## Special Guest Star - Kris Reeves

  - Background
      - Working with the team over the past few months
      - Focused on improving templates and matching process
      - Has been building tools for his NodeJS environment to discover
        licenses to meet client needs
      - Created a tool that makes a binary decision about whether there
        are any problematic licenses, yes or no
      - Wasn’t working well initially because of “naive” approach in the
        package he was using Node License Finder
      - Found 3 packages that were trying to do this
          - Node Packet Manager used SPDX short names
          - Which got Kris onto SPDX
          - Tool was not using matching guidelines properly
      - So Kris got onto trying to trying to fix
  - SPDX Work
      - Felt there needed to be some changes
      - Started submitted bug reports
      - Conclusion:
          - The templates were the right place to address issues he was
            running into
          - Developed tool in parallel to working on:
              - More Mark Up
                  - A big jump
                  - XML files that contain all info about a license
                  - Obsoleting spreadsheet
              - Better Mark Up
                  - XML is familiar and available
                  - Self-contained
                  - Better to have the matching info in the data for
                    tool consistency
              - Easier Contribution
                  - Separate GIt repo, bugzilla, etc system make
                    contribution awkward
                  - Feels GitHub web interface streamlines all that, so
                    advocating we migrate in that direction
          - Ideally all this reduces workload on Jilayne
          - Status
              - Has taken passes at converting licenses and submitted
                pull request
              - Still some issues he’ll work on this weekend.
              - Getting very close
