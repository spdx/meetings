## Business Team Report - Jack/Scott

  - Uboot
      - Popular project- boot loader for embedded devices
      - Approached us about defining a standard way to include
        SPDX-based license data in source code
      - The one challenge seems to be with handling non-standard license
  - Linuxcon
      - Great news that we were able to get a room for Tuesday. (we had
        had one for Monday, but there are a lot of general and legal
        track sections on that day we didn't want to overlap with.
      - Working on agenda, but will include a discussion with the guy
        from Samsung presenting on SPDX.

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne

  - Main focus is on creating marked up license templates
      - Daniel German has started taking formatted inputs from legal
        team and implement markups
      - Have been working out the process; seems very clear now.
      - Now just executing; should be at least well into it by LinuxCon
  - New licenses submitted:
      - Uboot
      - Unlicense

## Tech Team Report - Jack

  - Spec 1.2
      - Should be released by LinuxCon
      - Tools will lag slightly. Could use more resources on tools,
        particularly tag value versions
      - May include a description of how to reference licenses in code
        (e.g. Uboot)
  - Jack has documented the spec release process. (Kudos to Jack\!)
      - Team agreed that for minor releases a tool lag is OK; for major
        releases, it should be simultaneous.
      - Would be good to have a 'diff' doc of some sort between releases
