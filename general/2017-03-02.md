## Special Presentation- Mark Charlebois / Rashmi Chitrakar, Qualcomm

  - Mark from corp R\&D, Rashmi from the open source group
  - Mark works on Dronecode
      - Goal is to build with Yocto
      - Want to provide good license info
      - At the outset Yocto build only supported SPDX 1.0 and uses
        FOSSology for scanning
          - Yocto is a distribution that comes with recipes for custom
            builds
      - Motivation
          - reducing scan times was key
          - FOSSology was taking as much as 6 days
          - Introducing LiD to address
  - (Deck is available)
  - Yocto
      - has a number of build stages
      - current integration was inserted after patch stage to only scan
        what’s patched
      - but that doesn’t allow for reusability
      - So, the approach was to scan upstream sources and focus scan on
        only patches
      - Uses Yocto archiver
  - FOSSology integration
      - Mark was not able to even get it going
      - Old, did not seem well maintained
  - New integration
      - Implements approach to
      - Leverage newer SPDX capabilities
          - Relationships between files
          - Usage info (e.g. dynamic library)
      - Allows for parallelizing across machines
      - Can flag discrepancies (e.g. two different licenses declared)
      - Goal
          - create a federated commons of pre-scanned code
          - so, everyone’s work is cut by, say, 90% (as they only need
            to scan their customer 10%)
  - LiD
      - Main Features of Scanners
          - They have access to FOSSology tools (Nomos, Monk)
          - Evaluated using Qualcomm code for testing
          - Nomos was pretty good at detecting license language (94%)
          - Monk, only about 25%
          - Used SPDX license list as source for license matching
      - Goal
          - Aiding in license compliance
          - Hope was to generate SPDX
  - Main functions
      - Scans source code to ID license language
      - Natural Language Process “Bag of words” approach
      - Jakarta index shows how well it matches
      - Levenstein measures to determine where to start/end
      - Output- color coded matches (and deviations)
      - Matched about as well as Noms
      - Accuracy
          - Right license
          - Right region
      - Better than Nomos at extracting full text; Monk really fell
        short
      - Can be tuned
          - Based on LiD Scores (1-perfect)
              - Scores of above .6 were pretty good, but user can adjust
          - Nomos, being REGEX based is very computationally expensive.
  - Will be available on GitHub
      - But available already

  - Q\&A
      - What’s going on with Debian?
      - It’s being tested on Debian, not a lot of feedback yet

## Tech Team Report - Kate

  - Spec
      - Have been working on reference examples
          - Filling in how to do examples
      - Spec being converted to docbooks for style
          - Mobile-friendly
      - Getting the spec up on GitHub so changes can be tracked, pull
        requests, etc
          - Eventually we’ll move there from Bugzilla for issue tracking
      - FacetoFace in Tahoe
          - Jilayne did a great presentation that is available as video,
            Kate’s as well
          - JSON format discussion
  - Tools
      - Talked through plans at Face to Face

## Outreach Team Report - Jack

  - Accepted for Google Summer of Code
      - Starting to get interest
  - Short meeting last week
      - Talked about feedback from Matt’s project surveying companies
      - Need to decide if we will do a survey
      - Jack says we really need to look at the Ecosystem
          - Define user types and what to tell them they should do
          - Need to paint a picture of what success is with SPDX
          - Some feedback from site “I’m a developer, what do I do?”
  - Considering whether we need someone on the outreach team who is more
    OSS community-focused
      - Perhaps looking at “SPDX lite” (wrong word) sort of approach,
        and easy way to get started

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne/Paul

  - Good meetings at Tahoe
      - 2 hour working session
          - Action plan for XML conversion
          - How to completely connect the dots and organize upcoming
            task
  - Today’s call will follow up
  - Brad Edmondson developing deck and presenting to ABA group
