  - SPDX 2.2
      - moving on pull requests being merged/included.
      - Tools for generating Multiple formats being tested (help
        welcome).
  - SPDX 3.0
      - Identifying a common base (based on some of NTIA framing work)
        with specific profiles (licensing, security, pedigree,
        provenance, export)
      - SPDX 2.2 would be a base+licensing profile.
  - Related Groups
  - OMG including part of the SPDX models, people regarding as a point
    to add security information.
  - NTIA phase 1 documents are published at <https://www.ntia.gov/sbom>
    (SPDX is a recognized format there).
  - NTIA phase 2 workgroups are forming, and there will be one on
    "formats & tooling” (which will feature SPDX tools ;-) ) those
    interested in participating in discussions on tooling and how to use
    tools are welcome to subscribe at:

      - nothing beyond above, mostly testing new formats

## Legal Team Report - Paul/Steve

  - Fairly quiet this Q, lighter participation
      - 3.8 release will be light on new licenses
  - Reviewing and updating license inclusion guidelines
      - Should end up with broader inclusion at some level
          - particularly for non-OSS licenses that include making source
            available
      - Good legal/tech team collaboration on 3.0
          - One key topic is the license for the docs
              - Currently CC0
              - This has raised some concerns
              - Dredging up historic rationale
