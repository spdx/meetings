## Legal Team Report - Rockett

  - Circulated draft of revised trademark & compliance statements
      - Deep discussion on this topic resulted in additional proposed
        changes
      - "Policing" policy concerns raised; recommendation is to follow
        LF policy of community notification
      - Concerns about requiring attribution/compliance statement inside
        SPDX file requiring change to spec
      - Decided that no attribution statement will be included in SPDX
        file at this time; we will revisit post 1.0 GA
      - Rockett has the action item to send final wording to Kate
  - Data license discussion
      - Some team members concerned that use of PDDL, even with language
        about side-agreement re confidentially may affect adoption of
        spec by those who are working with packages that contain
        proprietary code
      - Other team members believe that allowing data licenses other
        than PDDL will affect adoption by open source community
      - Noted that Karen Copenhaver discussed this use with the author
        of PDDL and we have agreement that this use is compliant with
        intent of license; current wording provided by Karen C. after
        review with author
      - Decided that v1.0 will stipulate PDDL as only license for data
