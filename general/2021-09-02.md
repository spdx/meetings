  -   - Background
          - About 8 years ago, we put in place a governance structure
            for SPDX.
          - Factors
              - ISO standardization- near to announcing
              - Executive Order
              - More participation from comm members with standards body
                experience
              - Working with other standards, i.e. SWID and CycloneDX

<!-- end list -->

  -   - Goal of Change - retain spirit and ways of working
          - more accurately reflect the current reality and future
            direction of the project
          - establishing a mechanism for official company membership in
            the project
          - using contribution processes and a license for the spec that
            ensure explicit patent license  commitments from
            contributors
          - improving clarity around decision-making processes and
            establishing an appeals process
          - adopting a code of conduct

<!-- end list -->

  -   - Solution - Steve to explain further
          - Legal Entity creation- switched from JDF to a much simpler
          - Retained Community Specification model

<!-- end list -->

  - Review of pdf Summary - Steave
      - Legal Entity
      - Membership Agreement
      - Community Specs process and license

<!-- end list -->

  - Q\&A/Discussion
      - Various clarifications
      - Code of Conduct
          - Agreed that under new structure it could, if need be, be
            modified in the future
      - Possibility of Dual-licensing Spec
          - Agreed to not address at this time

<!-- end list -->

  - Resolution
