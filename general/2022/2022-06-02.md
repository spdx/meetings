## Tech Team Report - Gary/Kate/Thomas

### Spec
* SPDX 2.2.2 has been released
  * docs bugs have been resolved, and can be accessed at: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/
* SPDX 2.3 is close to feature complete,  we'll be declaring a release candidate in the next week, and generating ontologies for the tools to start trying it out.
  * Likely aiming to release in next couple of weeks
  * Documented in spdx-spec GitHub repo re: remaining tasks and activities
  * Only a couple items left impacting syntax of documents; hoping they'll be resolved this week, though can't commit b/c seeking consensus across multiple teams and time zones
  * Aiming to have a draft schema out w/in a week after consensus, to be available for review
  * Tooling folks then to update tools in parallel
  * A couple of big issues _separate from_ those impacting the syntax: e.g. license namespaces, licenses and snippets; intending to be compatible with existing syntax, but want to document in spec if adopting
* SPDX 3.0 moving in parallel,  revised model posted.
  * William leading up core profile team effort
  * Small list of outstanding items, will soon transition to documentation phase, moving from visual to written model
  * Defects profile, canonicalisation, usage profile
  * WG:  AI BOM team meeting regularly, looking at defining how to define training data, data sets, etc., starting to work up minimal set of fields
    * focused on how to represent models and training data for models
*  WG: SPDX Implementers Group - meeting to discuss best practices around generating SPDX documents, meeting every other Wednesday
* WG: Build data - Brandon Lum heading up recurring meeting, Monday nights European time
* WG: Canonicalization - Meets on Friday,  discussing the serializations for the 3.0 model.

* Desire to have working group meetings listed and calendar invites visible
  * Sebastian - looking to update wiki in short term, https://wiki.spdx.org/
  * Gary - currently discussed primarily on tech team list
  * Jilayne - would it make sense to add meeting times to https://github.com/spdx/meetings -- main README

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne/Paul/Steve
* License List 3.17 released in May
* Focus currently on discussion of cross-team topics for spec - license namespaces, etc.
* Looking to get a bit more formalization on cross-team topics:
  * avoid multiple conversations on separate calls, look to have joint calls where appropriate
  * proposals for something significant and new: aim to be more disciplined in articulating what's being solved for, e.g. "problem statement" / "what is this trying to achieve"; articulate how this fits into the mission of the project
  * try to define the goals / problem statement before jumping to implementation
* Namespace discussion tomorrow - https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-tech/message/4539; please read first before coming to meeting
