  - Most of the work is focused on the core model.  We’re making
    progress but still have a ways to go to settle on a good code the
    other profiles will be built on.
  - A new repo has been setup for the SPDX 3.0 spec since it will have a
    different way of generating the examples and spec and will also be
    under the new license as part of the new governance we put in place
  - We expect more activities on the profiles next month, especially
    security
  - Interest in the spec and tools continues to increase – we’re seeing
    some good signs of adoption from companies, other open source
    projects, and individuals (if you need more detail – SW360 is
    engaged in some issues conversations on the tools, the SPDX 2.1 spec
    issues has some new contributor)
