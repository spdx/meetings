# SPDX General Meeting Minutes - June 1, 2023

## Administrative
* Lead by Phil Odence / Rose Judge
* Minutes from last meeting approved 
* Attendance: 42

## Steering Commitee Update - Phil
* Chair Election results - Rose Judge selected as Chair

## Presentation on GUAC- Brandon/Michael
* Getting directed and actionable insights from your SBOMs from GUAC
* Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition - a knowledge graph of software metadata to answer security and supply chain questions
* Why GUAC? Analyzing our software supply chains are complicated (transitive dependency chains can be long)
  * Too much and too little data at the same time. We need to understand the relationships between all this data
* Trust foundation (Sigstore), software attestations (SLSA), aggregations and synthesis (GUAC), policy and insight
* What questions do we want to answer with GUAC?
  * How do I prevent large scale supply chain comprimise? What projects do I need to be concerned about?
  * Have I taken the right safeguards? Is a project I rely on taking the right security measures?
  * How am I affected by a new CVE?
* Support for informational queries (which software is affected by vuln x?) and evidence queries
* Two major use cases:
    * Public service: Ingests all verifiable documents from public records; queryable by public
    * Organization: private internal knowledge graph instance consisting of software used within org
* Demo
