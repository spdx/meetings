## Tech Team Report - notes sent by Kate

  - Thomas continues to get closer on 2.1.1 release, most changes from
    Trevor merged now.
  - Reviewed PURL proposal and concensus was to adopt for 2.2, after we
    see it finalize and be picked up by other projects.
      - PURL is a a generalized way to specify a package.
  - Discussion of multiple formats being supported (JSON, YAML, etc.), 
    as long as there are translation tools, and we follow the RDF
    naming, agreement to introduce them in 2.2.

      - There are a number of others, the he believes might be
        candidate.
          - He’ll prioritize and will “drip” to the Legal Team
      - Also some discussion about what to do, if anything, about
        proprietary licenses
          - Could be make sense to have a common identifier for commonly
            used ones
              - Could conceivably use the same architecture for
                proprietary
  - Also discussing a “relaxed” format.
      - Not necessarily including all the checksums
      - So could might introduce levels of SPDX compliance (A, AA,
        AAA…or something)
  - Discussion of how to get more lawyers involved.
      - Women lawyers would be particularly welcome
