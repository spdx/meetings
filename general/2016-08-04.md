## Special Guest - Alexios Zavras, Intel

  - His role is open source compliance at Intel, based in Munich
      - Now at open source tech center
      - Will be talking about his previous role with Intel Mobile Comms
  - Mobile Comms
      - Based in Germany
      - Germans are very process-oriented, well-documented
  - His role was SW legal compliance.
      - Ensuring all software legally compliant across all kinds of
        software
      - They treat all compliance issues as a bug, just like any problem
        in the software
      - Alexis learned of SPDX and was very pleased and excited about it
          - Didn’t manage to get everything SPDX based
          - Started slowly
          - SPDX is very valuable at many levels
              - Even just the license list and standard way of
                expressing was very helpful
              - Quickly standardized on SPDX notations and it started
                appearing in their documentation etc
          - Included in training that was mandatory for SW devs and
            later extended to marketing, legal, biz dev
              - Everyone who touches software had to take on-line course
                with a deeper course available for some
          - Have developed number of tools, tightly coupled with dev
            environment
              - All developed internally
              - very tightly controlled, eg can’t check out code without
                a ticket
              - Tool chain includes license compliance
          - Central team provides compliance services to dev
              - too much for all devs to worry about
              - Fits with org structure
              - Internal teams reviews all code
          - Started small, then more widespread and more automated
              - Today every release goes though this license compliance
                check
              - Requires ‘stamp of approval’ from central team
          - To make the central team more efficient
              - Save all results
              - Including many of the SPDX fields
              - Saved in database
          - Last step, not yet taken, is to generate an SPDX doc for
            each release
              - Just held up by organizational issues, technically
                feasible
              - Being worked on
              - Have started getting the request from customers
                  - Not mentioning SPDX by name, have not seen that yet,
                  - but asking for data that SPDX covers, files,
                    license, etc
                  - (both are with Euro customers)
          - When they generate SPDX
              - Permissive license require attribution
              - They’ve had an issue with that going back 5 years
              - Their policy to handle is to deliver all OSS in source
                form
              - So, therefore include attribution in comments
              - They include a list of open source and model licenses,
                but the attribution is all in source code
          - Example- Modem company
              - Intel provides chips and software in binary form
              - Packaging: With binary they include
                  - all source for open source in binary
                  - And, list of conditions for any 3td party
                    proprietary code
          - Are they being asked for security vulnerabilities associated
            with components
              - Not yet, but they are thinking about it with respect to
                naming (CPEs, etc)
  - AZ- “Thanks for the wonderful work. It’s really helpful.”
