## UNO - Matt Germonprez

  - Tools
      - DoSOCS - evolved from Yacto tool
          - Generalized to create ways of generating SPDX docs from
            various dev processes
          - Resulted DoSOCS- Ways to scan packages and repos (now
            source, but in theory binary) to generate SPDX
              - Main use case is generating SPDX 2.0 docs
              - Store in a relational database - trick was mapping
                obj-oriented SPDX to rel database
              - Very generic. Even on the back end; developed with
                FOSSology, but could plug in commercial scanners
              - Future- intake of SPDX
              - Idea is that this will eventually pull in all tools Git,
                Yacto, etc
              - And, can be tied into Jenkins
              - Ultimately will support an enterprise process to
                maintain a inventory of SPDX docs that come out of their
                processes
          - Also exploring production of security vulnerability info
              - Looking for where vulnerability info could be stored.
              - Need a spot for CPE (and other common ID standards)
              - Which would allow for vulnerability info
              - Tech team has been pursuing this idea
              - Group needs to address the mission creep issue
      - Git Scanner
          - Analyzes branch and contributes SPDX doc
      - Eclipse Plug In
