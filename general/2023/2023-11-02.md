## Administrative

* Minutes from last meeting to approve: https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/493
  * Approved

## Presentation: Actionable SBOM Lifecycle with DevSecOps Practices
* Presenter: Hasan Yasar, Technical Director and Faculty Member at Carnegie Mellon University
* SBOM all about creating the file with tools
* DevSecOps: a cultural engineering practice that breaks down barriers and opens collaboration between development, security, and operations organizations using automation to focus on rapid, frequent delivery of secure infrastructure and software to production.
* How to make minimum elements actionable?
  * Minimum practices for SBOM:
    * Data fields: document baseline info about each component that should be tracked (i.e. the min elements)
    * Automation support: automatic generation and machine-readability to allow for scaling across the software ecosystem
    * Practices and processes: define the operations of SBOM requestions, generation and use
  * Start to build a secure pipeline for your development and deployment
  * Create and maintain software dependency for each build
  * Track all third party (including OSS) libraries used in: code development, build, and runtime
* Operations - how does it all fit:
  * SBOM Policy (Design/Source)
    * Policy to acquire/enforce (Vendor SBOM)
  * CI/CD Policy Compliance (Build, Analyze, Deploy)
    * Continuous Integration (GitLab)
    * Policy Compliance
    * Continuous Deployment
  * Understand how to create, test, validate and recognize SBOM across DevSecOps
* Integrate and automate SBOM (demo/example)
* Want to use GUAC will provide more traceability to dependencies/relationships
