# SPDX General Meeting Minutes - September 7, 2023

## Administrative
* Lead by Rose Judge
* Minutes from last meeting to approve: https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/399
  * Approved

## Presentation: Why do we Need SPDX for Functional Safety?
* Presenters are Kate Stewart, VP Dependable Embedded Systems at the Linux Foundation, and Nicole Pappler, CTO at AlektoMetis.com
* Safety analysis is performed on Systems
* Safety is the freedom from unacceptable risk of physical injury or of damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the enviornment
  * Functional Safety (FuSa) is the part that depends on a system or equipment operating correctly in response to its inputs.
  * FuSa aims to detect potentially dangerous conditions, resulting either in the activation of a protective or corrective device or mechanisms to prevent hazardous events or in providing mitigation measures to reduce the consequences of the hazardous event.
* Goal of FuSa: Minimize risk to an acceptable level
  * Acceptable risk is risk accepted by society, e.g. risk that is considered to be part of everyday life
* Safety is a system problem
  * Systematic capability is the general assumption that software is capable of performing as intended
* Functional safety standards: define your dependencies and keep them up to date
* Maitenance: Requirements are needed to know you're "done" after applying a patch
* SBOMs today are machine readable which can help FuSa to a path of automation
* Safety standards are looking for:
  * Unique ID
  * Dependencies of component
  * Documentation
  * Requirements
* How can SPDX support FuSa?
* Dependency identification on component level - FuSa SBOM is a knowledge graph to organize the information
  * Requirement Traceability: i.e. if you apply a patch you have evidence that the requirements are satisfied
  * SPDX gives us a framework for looking at this type of information
    * Provides a complete model of dependencies in a safety related project
    * Supports effective impact analysis methodologies
    * Provides reproducible results in both impact analysis and evidence generation
    * Formal way to demonstrate completeness after project after tailoring and for different scopes
* What industries are most interested in this?
  * Strictly regulated industries: Healthcare, automotive, industry automation, energy sector, aircraft, railroad; anything where if things go wrong and human life is at risk
* Where does LF play a role if at all?
  * Some projects are working on this
* How does functional safety work for projects that already exist where Requirements are not available?
  * This case is not really being considered at the moment - very advanced

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary/WIlliam 
* Core & Software Profiles - Gary/Kate/William
  * Focused on remaining items for RC2 release
  * Working on issues identified through implementation efforts and serialization
* Security Profile - Thomas/Jeff/Rose
  * Working through writing JSON code for model examples which led us to update several properties in the security profile
* Licensing Profile - Steve
  * No update
* Build Profile - Brandon/Nisha
  * No update, mostly complete
* Lite Profile - Ito/Ninjouji/Asaba/Kobota
  *  Working on adding in constraints
* AI Profile -  Karen/Gopi
  * Decided on the required fields on the profile and worked on identifying the appropriate use cases to demonstrate the strength of the profile and the identify potential shortcomings
  * Working on how to represent mandatory relationships and external profile restrictions 
  * Looking at autopilot use case,  and discussion on whether we are representing risks appropriately
  * Looking at how to interact with new OpenSSF AI/ML working group
* Functional Safety - Nicole/Kate
  * Refining how different types of SBOMs handle different artifacts.
  * Presentation to SPDX General Meeting,  as well as ELISA Webinar
  * Starting to discuss tooling that can be applied for tracking these aratifacts that are not "source code"
* Canonicalization / Serialization - Max/Gary
  * Decided on how to handle "blank nodes" in the JSON-LD serializations
  * Working through how to consistently handle namespaces and "round tripping" between different formats
* Software as a Service â€“ Gary
  * Continued work on the use cases
  * Decided to focus on use cases involving multiple organizations (shared) vs. internal use cases
* Hardware - Kate
  * Kick off meeting held,  and meeting every other week now.   Those interesetd in the area, are welcome to attend.
* Implementers - Rose
  * Reviewed the current list of active SPDX tools for the SPDX website release

## Legal Team Update - Jilayne/Steve
* Hackfest / work session for upcoming 3.22 release - this Friday at 2:30PM Eastern US time on the usual legal team Jitsi link
* Decision needs to be reached soon regarding DataLicense for SPDX 3.0 spec - https://github.com/spdx/change-proposal/issues/8
* Fedora adoption of SPDX IDs is significant
* Help always welcome - please reach out or join the legal calls

## Outreach Team Update - Alexios/Bob
* Getting the website ready to support and describe 3.0 as well as everything before it

## General Announcements
