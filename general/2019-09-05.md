## Special Presentations - Hiro Fukuchi, Sony

  - SPDX- Lite
      - Open Chain Japan Work Group
          - Member companies- Toyota, Denso, Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony,
            Fujitsu, Olympus, Renesas
      - Common Problem- Can’t get OSS information from suppliers (HW
        vendors, ODMs, SOC, partners…in Asia (China/Taiwan) and Japan
          - They don’t have complete information
          - Don’t have the tools to generate and evaluate
      - SPDX Lite is part of guidelines
          - Fits in at a fairly high level of maturity
              - OpenChain - “Making Process”
              - SPDX (and OSS tooling) - “Improving Process”
              - Most suppliers are at low levels of maturity
          - Looking not to fork, but to expand usage of SPDX Lite
      - Lite Description
          - Subset of SPDX
          - Minimum requirement
          - Can be manually generated
          - Proved in actual business use
      - Scenarios
          - 1 Unskilled suppliers
              - Useful at a lower level of maturity than SPDX requires
          - 2 Non-engineering Staff
              - More understandable by Legal and Procurement staff.
          - Skilled suppliers would still use full SPDX
              - OpenChain compliant suppliers would be sophisticated
                enough
      - Question: Is SPDX Lite fully SPDX compliant
          - Yes, all mandatory fields are included in SPDX Lite plus
            some of the optional fields may be included.
