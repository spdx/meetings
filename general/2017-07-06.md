## Guest Presentation - Anna Buhman

  - Goals: Integrate GitHub with SPDX
      - Auto Generation
      - And kept up to date
      - Therefore easier to use
  - Uses
      - Repo admin sets up
      - Or non admin or someone outside could generate as well
      - Perhaps on a portion of the code
  - How it works
      - Scans using an open source scanner with every change
      - Creates doc and a pull request for updated doc which human must
        approve
          - anticipates needing some human modifications
      - Above is working today
  - Future modifications
      - Rather than replacing, combing with old version to retain human
        mods
      - Email notification of new docs
      - User-selectable license scanner
  - Project comments
      - Learning lots about different kinds of software
          - Example, learning about controlling GitHub with Python code
      - SPDX seemed very complicated at first
      - But understanding licensing she understands the requirements
      - Work so far is on GitHub in the SPDX area; Wiki too
  - Questions:
      - How to keep from overwriting human modifications?
          - Compare section by section and default to original giving a
            human the choice
      - When will a demo be available?
          - Maybe on a future call

## Tech Team Report - Kate/Gary

  - Spec source is now on GitHub, versioned, etc,
      - Big thanks to Thomas Steenbergen

  - Tooling
      - Summer of Code students have been giving updates
          - Gitter account set up wth lots of good conversations

## Legal Team Report - Jilayne/Paul

  - Good last few calls
  - XML Format
      - Gary set up a we to view previews
      - Down to last few files
  - Discussion about Linus’ note about GPL
      - Linus tried to clarify what it applied to our not
          - explicit about user space not subject to being a derivative
            work
      - Not calling it a license exception, per se, but will likely be
        treated as we treat exceptions
      - Not a clear way to represent; working on that now
      - There had been two versions, but that was cleaned up
  - Some chatter on mailing list about how we identify “only” as in GPL
    2.0 Only
      - Problem: We are explicit about “or later” but not about “only”
      - Working with FSF who would prefer: GPL-2.0-Only
      - Considering modifications to the expression language
