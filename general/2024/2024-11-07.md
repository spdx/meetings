  SBOM Generation Reference Implementations
- <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14DSi_PI1vd9hk2cQmsusu6cMuMiHeoFkVl2TgTOmhcc/edit?usp=sharing>
- Generating more complete SBOM
- Not only ones from tooling but also from human authors. Fields like description.
- Format and platform agnostic.
- 3 phases of supporting
- One: Java/Keycloak, containerized Python/Django apps (done)
- Three: Embedded (not yet, but progressing with support from some of the people here as well)
- 3-step SBOM creation approach
  - Generate: from tools
  - Augment:  from human. Things you have to have. Like license.
  - Enrich: using data from other sources (automated)
- Demo: Generated 115 lines vs Final 3xx
- Validate with sbomqs - got higher score
- Q&A
  - Q: Apart from the score, what is the quality improvement in real use? A: Would like to know a way to measure that as well
  - SBOM regression test. Having a dummy SBOM to check if fields were dropped
- Plan for FOSSDEM Brussels in Feb 2025. There will be a marketplace for open source tools
<https://pretix.eu/aboutcode/fosdem-2025/>
- Question on Package URL (PURL). A: Big fan. But Package URLs are not necessary unique. But there are use cases, for example comparing two packages.
- Package URL will be ECMA standard
- <ian.dunbar-hall@lmco.com> or idunbarh on OpenSSF Slack
