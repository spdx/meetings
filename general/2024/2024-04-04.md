    and others can add to it?
  - Bob to talk to Kate and Karen and try to share something more broadly
- Adrian: Has there been any work toward creating a Cryptographic Bill of
  Material (CBOM) profile for SPDX 3.0? Might be similar to Operations profile,
  but more on export side, but could create a new profile team that would
  make sense. Adrian to maybe look into starting this up

  - How do we deal with that in terms of the license fields
