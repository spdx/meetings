  - Approved 

## Presentation: Dots - A Visual Editing Tool Designed to Help Newcomers Get Started Quickly with SPDX-3
- Presenter: Ilan schifter
- Dots tool: github.com/condots/dots
- Dots is a visual editing tool designed to help newcomers get started quickly with SPDX 3. It can be used for creating, editing and exploring SPDX documents.
- Ilan found SPDX through general SBOM experience -- difficult to force cdx to be a graph and describe the software supply chain this way and eventually found SPDX
- A graphical SBOM authoring tool. A user can select from a menu to create an object of a class, add values to its properties, and also add relationship between objects.
- Dots starts empty - loads the latest ontology - parses it, creates the class definitions
- Enforces requirements of the spec (i.e. created date in CreationInfo)
- Shows issues when requirements not met/missing object property/missing edge
- If you want to drag an edge to an instance that you created - it will show you potential connections when dragging around in the WebUI
- Everytime we have a new spec version, dots will load ontology and everything works - why there’s no history 
- Can get a preview of what an element/node will look like once it’s exported to SBOM format
- Can upload an SBOM to the tool and it will render in the Dots UI
- Datatypes can be enforced through the interface, for example for date time datatype, the input interface for that property will be a date time picker.
- Mandatory property that is still missing will be shown in red border. Its parent object will also have a red dot at the corner.
