### Functional Safety Team - Nicole/Kate

### Hardware Team - Kate
- No updates

### Implementers Team - Rose
- Worked on RC2 release and currently focused on the serialization discussion impact on tooling

### Licensing Profile Team - Steve
- Significant updates for 3.0rc2 have been in the working draft for a while now
- Tool implementers, please submit feedback on proposed licensing-related profiles from rc2, particularly the split into "SimpleLicensing" and "ExpandedLicensing" profiles

### Lite Profile Team - Ito/Ninjouji/Asaba/Kobota
- Wrote up some JSON schemas for the lite profile
- Will sync the JSON schema work with the serialization discussions on next week's call

### Operations Team - Matthew Crawford
- We have discussed the proposed fields. Tomorrow (2:30pm UK time) we plan to do a final review before opening this to the wider community for review/comment.
- We have excluded original proposed fields around patents and just focusing on export control and operations.

### Security Profile Team - Jeff
- Some feedback on VEX profile - a separate meeting will be held this month

### Serialization Team - Joshua Watt
- Progress has been made finalizing the JSON(-LD) serialization of SPDX 3.
- The current plan is to have all documents be fully valid JSON-LD, but use a JSON schema to restrict the documents to a strict subset of JSON-LD. This ensures that there is only 1 JSON-based format that tools have to deal with, and it can be parser with either a full JSON-LD parser (if you need the full power of linked documents), or it can be parsed with simpler JSON parser since the schema enforces a simpler structure. Because of this choice, there is no plan for a distinct "simple JSON" format, as the same format can be used for both cases.
- The SHACL ontology, JSON Schema, and JSON-LD context file should be available for testing soon.
- No progress on Tag-Value yet

### Software as a Service Team â€“ Gary
- Completed our first use case
- Starting second use case focused on security and certification

## Legal Team Update - Jilayne/Steve
- Business as usual in terms of lots of open issues and needing help reviewing licenses; helpful to have experience with looking at licenses for this, but those people don't seem to help out... PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
- Updates to documentation to try to make things easier to follow, etc. - see:
  - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-fields.md - added info re: how these maps to XML tags
  - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/license-match.md - new resource!
  - https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/main/DOCS/history.md - added some more detail re: evolution of SPDX License List format

## Outreach Team - Alexios/Bob
