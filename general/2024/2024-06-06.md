## Administrative

## Presentation: SPDX 3 and the Yocto Project - A case study of migrating from SPDX 2 to SPDX 3
- Presenter: Joshua Watt (Garmin)
- "Target Image" - firmware, images that can boot on PC, QEMU, OCI compliant container images
- 2021: Yocto project needs SBOMs
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5UQUM6zxVU
- Build images from Source Code - uses bitbake
- Might be building on one architecture and building for another, target packges cross compiled
- The way bitbake tracks what needs to be built is using sophisticated method of hashing - tracks tasks, hashes them, hashes the source inputs and when something changes it knows everything downstream of that needs to be rebuilt.
- Levraged the strength of the dependency tracking and added in extra tasks that write out SPDX documents as they go along. When they build a target package there's an extra task that builds the SBOM for that task.
  - This worked pretty well ~2k lines of python to do this
  - At the end, put all the smaller SBOMs in a final SPDX deliverable
  - SPDX 2 relationships/deps: build_dependency_of, runtime_dependency_of, contains, amends, generated_from
- Quirks: SPDX2 has no concept of a "build"; Merging documents is hard (so yocto uses a tarball for 2.2); Data of this magnitude can't be easily validated; SPDX 2.2 has no vulnerability information (yocto adds custom information which is only really understood by yocto); Tooling is all handwritten (Yocto has "zero dependency" rule) - hard to update between point releases
- What to do with the SBOM data? Are there any tools to consume and manipulate it? Can I use it to figure out XYZ? - All compounded because their SPDX 2.2 format is unique and unlikely 3rd parties will support their quirks
- SPDX 3.0 Addresses some of these shortcomings (Yay!)
  - SPDX3 Build information using the build profile - list inputs, trace input dependencies, nested builds, build invocation information (new relationships: `hasHost`, `invokedBy`, `delegatedTo`)
  - SPDX3 uses Linked Data: makes merging and linking documents much easier. Objects can have globally unique `SpdxId` (mandatory if Element can be referenced) which can be referenced by anyone; No namespaces which makes merging easier
- Yocto SPDX 3 Generation: Use a database that maps SpdxIds to files is kept as files are generated; Make heavy use of extensions to track extra information needed later in the intermediete documents; The final step is to aggregate all the documents to a final output document using the data base to recursively resolve missing SpdxIds
- SPDX3 Validation: SPDX3 has a formal SHACL model to validate the semantics of a document (but not necessarily the structure); SPDX 3 JSON-LD Documents must conform to a JSON Schema
- https://github.com/JPEWdev/shacl2code: a tool to consume the formal SHACL model and generate code bindings
  - Python bindings can be generated this way; should be published to PyPi soon
  - JSON Schema for validation is generated using this tool
  - Other bindings are in the works
  -  makes tool writing easier: Being able to generate meaningful code bindings reduces the barrier to entry for writing simple tools

- SPDX 3 makes it easy to communicate security info using the security profile
- SPDX3 is still a lot of data! October 2024 is when Yocto's next release will have SPDX3


## Tech Team Report
- Working through several documentation related issues - working towards a patch release.  Timing TBD.
- We have volunteers to translate the spec - we're working on the process and tooling to support the translations
- Doing some re-organizing of the spec - plan to move some of the non-normative, more informative sections to a separete "using" repo (i.e "how to use" documentation).  Work in progress. New repo is https://github.com/spdx/using

### AI / Dataset Profiles Team - Karen/Gopi
- No update

### Build Profile Team - Brandon/Nisha
- No update

### Functional Safety Team - Nicole/Kate
- No update

### Hardware Team - Kate
- No update

### Implementers Team - Rose
- Discussion picking up with 3.0
  - focusing on generating examples for tooling operators and documentation around validation/generation/best practices for 3.0
- Moving meeting cadence to every week in the wake of 3.0 release
- If you're working in Python, you can use Joshua's tooling to get started with SPDX 3
    - https://github.com/JPEWdev/spdx3merge
    - https://github.com/JPEWdev/spdx3query
- Discussing other language bindings; Gary working on Java; Nisha and Keith working on golang bindings
  - Looking for feedback on approaches for how to solve implementation of 3.0 spec in go
    - discussion on approaches to solving the inheritance model. We seem to be narrowing in on using interfaces only: https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang/pull/240 

### Licensing Profile Team - Steve
- No current meetings; handling issues in the repos as they arise in the ordinary course

### Lite Profile Team - Ito/Ninjouji/Asaba/Kobota
- No updates

### Operations Team - Matthew Crawford
- We have finalised the fields and will be presenting to the tech team on the 18th June.
  - After this time the fields will be open to the community for comment.
  - Please come along to the tech team on the 18th June if you would like to hear more.

### Security Profile Team - Jeff/Rose
- Meetings paused until further notice

### Serialization Team - Joshua Watt
- No updates

### Software as a Service Team â€“ Gary
- Worked through remaining use cases planned for 3.1
- Need volunteers to help with pull requests to implement some of the decisions
  (e.g. an X.509 external reference)
- Working through what level of information we want to capture about the security between the direct service provider and the indirect service provider dependencies

### Legal Team Update - Jilayne/Steve
- License List v3.24.0 released on May 22
- (note: per tech team's request, the License List is now using SemVer with .0 suffix)

### Outreach Team - Alexios/Bob
- Collecting data for tools handling SPDX (producing or consuming)
- If you are responsible for any tool, please submit a form in https://github.com/spdx/outreach/issues/new?assignees=&labels=tools&projects=&template=add-tool.yaml&title=%5bTool+Request
