## Legal Team Report - Jilayne

  - Working on explicitly defining the team's mission.
      - Current Draft (feel free to provide feedback to team/Jilayne):
        *"The SPDX Legal Team supports the SPDX working groups by
        providing recommendations to the SPDX working groups regarding
        licensing issues for the specification itself; providing input
        that will result in increased legal certainty of the licensing
        attributes of open source projects; maintain the SPDX License
        List; and to promote the SPDX specification to the legal
        community at-large."*
  - Similarly working on defining purpose of the License List.
      - Current draft (also open for feedback):*"The SPDX License List
        is a list of commonly found open source software licenses for
        the purposes of being able to easily and efficiently identify
        such licenses in an SPDX document. The SPDX License List
        includes a standardized short identifier and full name for each
        license, as well as other basic information. By providing a
        short identifier, SPDX creators (as well as others beyond SPDX)
        can efficiently refer to a license without having to redundantly
        reproduce the full license. The SPDX website (spdx.org)
        maintains the full text of each license on the SPDX License
        List. In keeping with the overall goal of the SPDX project, no
        interpretation of the licenses has been made and the SPDX
        Licenses List endeavors to only provide a factual list of
        licenses and short identifiers that can be consistently relied
        upon by users of the list."*
  - Reviewed and updated longer term to do list
  - Posted process for adding licenses to License List in Specification
    section of current website.
