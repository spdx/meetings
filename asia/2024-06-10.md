- Targeting 3.0.1 may conflict with timeline
- Will start with Annexes soon

### SBOM Comparsion
- discussed SBOM element comparison - spredsheet (link can be provided later)
 - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuGv1L3H_-Iq6dmH7DnjDgAa90LCRnoHB3DTfuWh0Jg/edit?gid=1936044844#gid=1936044844
  - Any coments are really welcome! 
- discussion on whether the FDA fields related to support level are more static (should be included with the SBOM) or dynamic (should be in a separate file)
  - Even if dynamic, SPDX can be used to represent the data
- discussed the equivalent CycloneDX fields - they may not support these fields in their SBOM format

### Separate "using SPDX repo"
- Moving SPDX Lite to separate repo - currently, there are some changes in progress, we don't want to move it before the changes are committed / merged - Make sure we notify Alexios, coordinate with Kobota san before moving it
- Other than coordinating on work in progress, no concerns with moving the lite documentation

### Examples repo
- Working on JSON-LD, would like to contribute to the examples repo.  Will work on 2.3 and 3.0 (JSON-LD) examples
- OK to contribute SPDX lite specific examples - create a new top level directory for the Lite profile and include subdirectories for each version (e.g. 3.0, 2.3)
