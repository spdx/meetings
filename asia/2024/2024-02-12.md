## Agenda
* LITE profile, last additions.
* FOSDEM recap

## Notes
* Should lite profile have downloadLocation and/or homePage added? (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/584)
  * Japan team have discussed,   PURL, downloadLocation and homepage as optional in orignal SPDX 3.0.   If package is same as orignal,  if supplier provides a PURL.   If not able to have PURL, need to have download location.
  * If no PURL,  then must have one of downloadlocation or homepage.    Is what is being looked for. 
  * Leave as optional in lite profile.
  * SBOM of small binary blobs - distribution hand by hand,  then PURL or Downloadlcoation, may be not be deterministic,   so not possible to put manditory.    
  * For download location,  PURL, homepage - should they be listed as "optional" in SPDX-LITE explicitly?   
    * No, only mandatory should be listed as mandatory.
    * Japan team will be writing guidance on how to use in future. 

* Recently, packageVersion is added in Package class and we think it as mandatory in Lite profile.
  * Still under discussion with Japan team.   Will send a pull request after discussion.
