# SPDX Tech Team Asia 2024-12-09

## Attendees
- Norio Koboto
- Nobuyuki Tanaka
- Yoshiyuki Ito
- Gary O'Neall

## Agenda
- Translations
- There are 2 pull requests for Japanese - one for the spec repo and one for the model repo
- SPDX spec repo - most of the branching infrastructure is in place with the exception of those dodcumented here: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1155
- Need to restructure directory for the english translationship
- SPDX 3 model repo
  - Branch structure waiting for 3.0.1 release
  - Document structure is already documented and followed by the Japanese translation pull request
- Reviews - in Japan, reviews are occuring on the repos before the pull request
  - Translations are reviewed prior to the pull requests
- Concern about the merge conflicts in the SPDX 3 model repo
  - we can coordinate between translations to avoid merge conflicts
- We should create a translations mailing list - I think Kate had that as an action
  - Gary will email Rob and Kate as a reminder
- Discussion on the multiple profiles and standards
  - OMG and SPDX are the same spec  / standard - also true for the ISO submission - practically only the cover page is different
  - Multiple industry standards may create a burden for SPDX producers
    - Suggestion that one SPDX document can support multiple profiles

## Notes

- SPDX-3-Model repo
