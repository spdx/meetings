## Notes
*  OpenChain Defects Spec gaining wider review https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/SecurityAssuranceGuide/tree/main/Guide/2.0  Note: This is a reference draft (not yet ready for use, but intended as a thinking tool)

* Time sensitive Request - does it make sense to have built date,  release date,  expiry date added to 2.3, with the vie they will live eventually in Usage profile for 3.0.
* Specification 2.2.2 - now.    Note:  no main change to spec, mostly typos & clarifications.
* Specification 2.3 - early-mid May for rc candidate.   External Ref to Defects/VEX + other key cases (? expiry date? etc)
* Specification 3.0 - end of Q2 to circulate to wider SPDX community & PR.   Target Q3 release candidate of spec.

* Roundtrip between CycloneDX & SPDX - prototype at https://github.com/goneall/spdxcyclone
