## Agenda

* Overview of purpose and scope of canonicalisation
* AOB

## Notes

* Sebastian showed slides visualising the different contexts of SPDX data between representation and communication: `semantic data <- SPDX Element <- SPDX File <- transmission`.

* Alexios gave examples of ambiguity in representation of software license texts, including use of different characters as bullet points. This would inhibit the ability to determine canonical representations for the semantic content of SPDX data.

* It was agreed among those present that the Canonicalisation Committee should focus on facilitating canonical representations of the middle two scopes (SPDX Elements and Files).

* Henk demonstrated a CDDL (Concise Data Definition Language) document for the draft SPDX 3.0 model, capable of unambiguous interpretation.

## Next meeting
