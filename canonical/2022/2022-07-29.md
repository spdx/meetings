## Notes

### Website demonstration

Sebastian showed the [new website for the Canonical Serialisation](https://spdx.github.io/canonical-serialisation/)  and [its repository](https://github.com/spdx/canonical-serialisation), with a demonstration of how the automated build works.

### Review of remaining issues to be resolved

Discussion of all the data types that need to be documented.
Created an [issue on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/spdx/canonical-serialisation/issues/5) listing these (this may not be conclusive though, as it does not include as yet unwritten profiles).
All agreed to focus on fundamental data types and format considerations for next week's meeting, and License Expressions the week after that.

## Action items

* Sebastian to contact Steve Winslow to ask about breaking changes to License Expressions in SPDX 3.0. Will CC Alexios.
