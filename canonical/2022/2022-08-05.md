## Notes

### CPEs

Discussion of the canonical representation of CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) values, used as External References in SPDX.
Maximilian Huber noted on GitHub issue that trailing wildcard values within the CPE can optionally be removed, adding a factor of variation that will need to removed in the SPDX Canonical Serialisation.

It was noted that the CPE schema indicates that version 2.2 CPEs are URNs, but version 2.3 CPEs are not.
The CPE 2.3 specification defines the 'well-formed name' (WFN) form of CPEs, intended to be a canonical form for version 2.3 CPEs.

Three options for representing CPEs in the Canonical Serialisation were proposed:

**'Object' option:**

``` json
{"part":"a","product":"php5-common","vendor":"debian","version":"5.3.2-1"}
```

**'Array' option:**

``` json
["a","debian","php5-common","5.3.2-1"]
```

**'String' option:**

``` json
"cpe:2.3:a:debian:php5-common:5.3.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"
```

Since all three options are equally suitable to form the basis of the canonical representation for CPEs, it was decided to call a vote on which to use.
Additionally, it was agreed to use the same option for both version 2.2 and 2.3 CPEs.

## Action items
