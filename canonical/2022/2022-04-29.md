## Notes

### Data serialisation formats

Discussion of which data serialisation formats to consider; all agreed to consider JSON and CBOR.
The performance considerations of cryptographic operations relating to the formats is brought up.
Henk notes that the only performance problem with ciphers on longer binary representations are that they take more memory.

It is considered what the largest element is that could be written; describing licenses will probably produce the largest elements.
The enumerations of licenses in the SPDX License List is discussed; it is noted that there is already such numbering in the SPDX License List data, but the numbering is not stable between releases.
Using numbers to refer to licenses is discussed, but since no decisions were come to, this will be revisited at a later point.

### Implementation targets for the SPDX Canonical Serialisation

Results of a poll to guage interest of implementations for different programming languages:

## Decisions

All agreed to start with the assumption that we'll use JSON, and look into CBOR if JSON widely support is not available or if conciseness is important.

## Topics for next meeting

* Starting to produce canonical representation for SPDX 3.0 data types
