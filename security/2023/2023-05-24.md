## Notes
### https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/346
* Why do we need https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/346
* json-ld is also json format; matches the syntax of json but it is also an RDF format
* Armin: no plan to drop the @type of element; there is no way to identify a type based soley on its properites [if we were to drop the @type]
* Jeff: is there consensus that we won't lose metadata in json-ld translations?
* Armin: it's a hard requirement that @type cannot be lost for serialization.
* Jeff: we need to have serialization discussion in tech call not in a one off meeting
* Kate: The issue is that if you look in relationships and relationship types - all of the types that have been listed are not there.. it has been boiled down to assessment 
* Rose: still confused why the relationship type name is lost
