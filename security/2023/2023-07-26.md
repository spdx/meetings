# SPDX Security Team Meeting - July 26, 2023

## Attendees
* Jeff Schutt
* Rose Judge
* Thomas Steenbergen
* Kate Stewart
* Karsten Klein

## Agenda
* Improvements to example diagram and JSON based on tech call feedback

## Notes
### Example diagram improvements
* Feedback from call:
  * Different arrows for properties vs relationships
  * Different agents asserting various security relationships
  * Align shapes with safety profile icons
* Core profile and security profile both include a `suppliedBy` property
* The security profile uses suppliedBy for vulnerability elements, with the original intent to use the element's suppliedBy property
* Recent creation of the artifact class in the core model caused this duplication
* Discused resolving this by having vulnerability elements inherit from artifact elements
* Realized that this only solves half the problem, it will not resolve the use of suppliedBy in the relationships defined by the security profile
* Recommendation: move the originatedBy and suppliedBy properties back to the element class
* Justification: they are being used as properties on the many relationships defined in the security profile, and likely to be used as properties on relationships in other profiles as well, e.g., licensing or AI
  * Filed SPDX 3.0 Github issue https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/436 for this
* The example diagram includes two agents who supplied the element, a person and an organization
    * The spdx 3.0 model correctly allows more-than-1 suppliedBy properties on an artifact
    * The [spdx-3-model diagram](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model.png) is wrong, indicating only [0..1] for suppliedBy
    * Filed SPDX 3.0 Github issue https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/437 for this
