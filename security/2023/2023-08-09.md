## Notes
### https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/437
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/437 - "One throat to choke" - who you go to if you need remediation/help
* Justification of the decision here: https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/main/tech/2023-03-21.md#supplier-property 
* If you want to indicate more suppliers, use relationships
  * The issue we stumbled upon last week was that suppliedBy is not a relationship, which is how this issue came about
  * The relationship is named "availableFrom" if you want to document all the other places the artifact is available from
* How to handle for Acme Application example: use Acme Company in `suppliedBy` property and use Jane Doe as the `availableFrom` relationship
  * This is complicated for a fairly common use case
  * Agreement to use this approach for 3.0 and try to change suppliedBy cardinality in 3.1
  * Rose will open PR to fix cardinality

### https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/436
* Potential solutions:
    * Move vulnerability to inherit from Artifact instead of Element
    * Add duplicate suppliedBy property to Vulnerability/AssessmentRelationship
* Other profiles will likely need suppliedBy property (i.e. Build, AI)
* What is the additional burden we are placing on someone to understand the model who wants to build a tool? Tool developers who want to implement multiple profiles that use similar properties but in slightly different ways may be confused 
  * Multiple definitions for profiles:
      * conformance point --> statement that if this SPDX serialization supports a profile it must include this information
      * namespace --> Helps us think about different collections of usecases and personas by dividing the classes definitions into chunks
* If someone is using a suppliedBy property on Artifact and Vulnerability inherits from Artifact then it's logical for them to understand, but if someone uses suppliedBy for license but they see that license doesn't inherit from Artifact - this is confusing
* Right now, license doesn't have originatedBy or suppliedBy but proposal to postpone this decision until 3.1. To do this it would need to subclass from Artifact. Would like to get 3.0 out the door first because this won't be a breaking change in 3.1. Agreement from group on this.
* Two parts of problem: security vulnerability class will inherit from Artifact in order to pick up suppliedBy and originatedBy properties. BUt we still need to do this for security relationships (and other profiles). In this case we will start defining the same property multiple times. A: point back to the other definition (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model/Core/Properties/suppliedBy.md). 
  * TODO: Need to tweak this definition in core to not refer specifically to Artifact.
    * Summary Current: Identifies who or what supplied the Artifact.
    * Summary Proposed: Identifies who or what supplied the artifact or VulnAssessmentRelationship referenced by the Element.
  * Description Proposed: Identify the actual distribution source for the artifact (e.g., snippet, file, package, vulnerability) or VulnAssessmentRelationship being referenced. This might or might not be different from the originating distribution source for the artifact (e.g., snippet, file, package, vulnerability) or VulnAssessmentRelationship.
  * Jeff will open PR in https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model/Core/Properties/suppliedBy.md
    * Update: PRs opened - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/473, https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/472
