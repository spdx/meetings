## Notes
### Update on action items from last Friday's workshop
* Thomas: Rewrote the MarkDown files to use relationships see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/security-profile-use-relationships and updated draw.io and png https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/security-profile. 
* Adolfo and Rose have  been making updates to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZT_w3HiW6LJjouRlw3xHXPnmy7ArwOdlw4vpzIjS9_o/edit?usp=sharing

### Continue to finish SPDX security model
* Need to define relationshipType for each of the assessments

```
        {
            "@type": "VulnerabilityCvssV3AssessmentRelationship",
            "@id": "urn:spdx.dev:cvssv3-1",
            "relationshipType": "VulnAssessment",
            "severity": "medium",
            "score": "6.8",
            "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N",
            "from": "urn:spdx.dev:cve-1", [1..1] // the Vulnerability
            "to": "urn:product-acme-application",  [1..1] // must be the productRootElement in this security bundle or in the SBOM document
            "assessedElement": "urn:bingo-buffer-v2.2", // [0..1]  a package, file, snippet, relationship
// urn:product-acme-application -> runtimeDependency ->  urn:bingo-buffer-v2.2 / urn:product-acme-application -> devDependency ->  urn:bingo-buffer-v2.2 
            "externalReferences": [
                {
                    "@type": "ExternalReference",
                    "externalReferenceType": "securityAdvisory",
                    "locator": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28498"
                }
            ]
        },
```
        
### Conclusion:
* VulnCvssV2AssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasCvssV2AssessmentFor
* VulnCvssV3AssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasCvssV3AssessmentFor
* VulnEpssAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasEpssAssessmentFor
* VulnSsvcAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasSsvcAssessmentFor
* VulnExploitCatalogAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasExploitCatalogAssessmentFor
* VulnVexAffectedAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: affects
* VulnVexNotAffectedAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: doesNotAffect
* VulnVexFixedAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: fixedIn
- VulnVexUnderInvestigationAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: underInvestigationFor<br>
~~* VulnOtherAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasOtherAssessmentFor~~ <br>
~~* VulnGenericAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype:  hasGenericVulnAssessmentFor~~
  * Move to be defined in GA, 3.0.1, or later -> ideally we have a dictionary enabling SPDX creators to define multiple key- values pairs; await SPDX 3.0 security profile end user input to learn what's missing
* VulnExploitCatalogAssessmentRelationship => Relationshiptype: hasExploitCatalogAssessmentFor
  * isListed: Boolean [1]
  * catalogType: kev, other [1]
  * locator: URL [0...*]
