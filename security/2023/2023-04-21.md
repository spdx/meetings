# SPDX Defects Team Workshop - April 21, 2023

## Attendees
* Rose Judge
* Gary O'Neall
* Thomas Steenbergen
* Henk Birkholz
* Jeff Schutt
* Sean Barnum
* Maximilian Huber
* Karsten Klein

## Notes
* Worked on the JSON example for the security profile and updated the security profile model appropriately
* Decided to use relationshipTypes for the security profile as relationships require timestamp(s) and Ids, which adds value over having only a property

### TODO
* Iterate on the JSON example to include examples for:
     * each relationshipType, including appropriate timestamps
     * how a VulnCategorization gets replaced
     * how vex affects multiple products..discussion w/ tech-team on rootElement to represent the product
* Update product profile & product class in security profile model to use RootElement 
* Queue up discussion for SPDX Tech Team
  1. how to update/replace relationships?
    * supplements: a opqaue statement provides additional information about another referenced opque statement 
    * replaces: adds an opaque fresh statement and redners a referenced opque statement stale 
    * refreshes: a non-opque statement that states that a referenced opaque or non-opaue statement is still fresh 
    * invalidates: a non-opaque statement that declares another opqaue or non-opaquie statement stale and therefore not valid anymore
  2. Making the suppliedBy relationship more generic because today only applies to artifacts
  3. ExternalIdentifier - add an identifierLocator and an issuingAuthority
  4. Add optional timestamps to relationships, e.g. startTime and endTime
  5. discuss if one can create relationship on Bundles? (model both relationship directions)
      From: Bundle of security information (vulnerability rootElement) relating TO: a single package or bundle of packages (SBOM)
      From a single package (rootElement) to a bundle of vulnerability information.
