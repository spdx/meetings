# SPDX Defects Team Workshop - April 5th 2023

## Attendees
* Thomas Steenbergen
* Adolfo Garcia Veytia
* Anthony Harrison
* Jeff Schutt
* Kate Stewart
* William Cox
* Gary O'Neall

## Agenda

* Comparing: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/security-profile/security-profile/security-profile.png to the generated markdown https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/168/files
* VEX discussion

## Notes
### Comparing model to generated markdown PR
* Vulnerability.md - ok to merge 
*  need volunteers to flesh out TODOs in all of the classes.
*  Compared original diagram with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxhbr/spec-parser.hs/04b227772ae3ab78b03b359818da4dd55e3342bf/Security.Profile.svg  
* Discussion of CVSS2 vs CVSS3 score - recommendation from Gary is that the properties should be different for RDF.   Two different specs,  with same properties, use different namespaces. 
  * Should have namespaces already defined, so should be able to reuse when at all possible. 
* Vulnerability is inherited from Artifact.  Can be collected in a bundle.  Lots of fields inherited from core. 
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/security-profile/security-profile/security-profile.spdx.json
* Lots of these fields are defined elsewhere, and decision to refer to those rather than reinvent when ever possible. 
  * CVSS (https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document)
  * SSVC (https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cisa-ssvc-guide%20508c.pdf )
  * EPSS (https://www.first.org/epss/ )
  * Exploit (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)

### VEX
* Adolfo want to have VEX comply with minimum requirements from NTIA working group. OpenVEX implements the NTIA minimum defined fields. 
* Product profile needs to be created,  some discussion on this as being out of scope of security profile. View is to tie it to the package in SPDX for now.   
   * Thomas indicated that the vulnerability can not be outside of its context of a package, in SPDX.  Built so it can be added at a later point. 
* A VEX statement can have a subcomponent;  Product A, uses library B - handle this with a relationship to each of the application, library, file. 
  * Need to give vulnerability categorizations an id, and make relationships between the vulnerabities. 
  * Making an id link betwen the vulnerability to package.
* Made decision not to encode certain actors in 3.0;  and post to 3.1
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/security-profile/security-profile/security-profile.png see bubble on actors
  * VEX inside the vulnerabilities. VEX can only talk about one vulnerability.

### Critical Path for Security Profile
* Kate and Gary are working to get the model released with a target of May; need security profile to be a part of that
