## Notes
### Recap from general meeting: how to address createdBy recursion issue
* createdBy metadata for an agent can describe the same organization/agent. Essentially a "root node" agent.
* Typically we would see a company referencing itself if they are reating the SBOM for software they create
* For the security use case where there is an individual/team associated with the company we would see the company create the createdBy metadata for the individual/team

### Clarified changes needed in https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/472 for suppliedBy
* Jeff will open a new PR to update the suppliedBy property used in security profile to reference core to avoid duplication of definitions

### Continue to work on JSON/drawio example
* See drawio and json file with corresponding date of this meeting in the meeting directory.
