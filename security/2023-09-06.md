* Approved and merged https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/454
* Approved and merged https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/463
* From PR 463 there a discussion on how based to commit draw.io example, Jeff proposes to have a one file but export to PNG upon committing after each Defects meeting.
* Rose proposes keeping the drawio file since there's 4 tabs. We can upload pngs once the changes to the diagram slow down/stop (likely once we're done writing the JSON example code)
* Thomas:  maybe we can investigate using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/draw-io-export-action to automate the draw.io to PNG export.
  * Jeff: further research needed to see if it works.
* Topics for next week: article answering common questions (topic from last week), continue with exampe code
