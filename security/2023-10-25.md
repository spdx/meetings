## Notes
### Review and approve open PRs
* Jeff approved meeting minutes from last week. Need Gary to also approve, then merge
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/535
  * Discussed and the general consensus of the security team is to reflect the case of the schema that we're reusing (in this case CVSS), rather than change it to accommodate SPDX-specific implementation (e..g., RDF).
  * Rose will clarify with Alexios about his comments
* Discussed what's next for security team
  1. Move the drawio diagram for Acme Application to the playground
  2. Provide a set of security profile examples in the example repo that reflect the drawio diagram
  3. As we build the json examples...
    * Review constraints on security relationship classes in the model and define them when needed
    * Make updates to the model and/or drawio diagram based on latest changes/decisions across SPDX 3  

### Diagram example
* TODO: move our security diagram to https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-serialization-prototype-playground
* Next week, begin building the JSON-LD example from the diagram and prior work
