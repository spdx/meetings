## Notes
### Questions about new CVSSv4 relationship
* `Label` property proposed in CVSSv4 assessment
  * label is not currently present in the 4.0 schema which is what we based our changes off of
  * `severity` property is not properly uppercased: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model/Security/Classes/CvssV4VulnAssessmentRelationship.md
    * Rose will open a PR to fix this
      * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/535

### EPSS PR to review
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/514
* Alexios merged at Tuesday Tech call

### Issue for consistent naming purl
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/493
* Rose will open a PR to help facilitate discussion in the general tech call

### Different CVE scores from different issuers
* Use `publishedBy` (or others) for the vulnerability assessment relationship - can describe the vendor/org/project that is assessing the CVE vulnerability score and create multiple relationships for the multiple issuers
* Maybe this is something we want to add as an example to our diagram or in the model?
