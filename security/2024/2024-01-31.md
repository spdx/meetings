# SPDX Security Team Meeting - January 31, 2024

## Attendees
* Jeff Schutt
* Karsten Klein
* Gary O'Neall
* Kate Stewart
* Dick Brooks

## Agenda
* close any remaining security-related PRs for SPDX 3.0 RC2

## Notes
* Jeff will submit a PR to move `PackageVerificationCode` into the appropriate namespace in the model: model/Core/Classes/PackageVerificationCode.md
* Jeff, Alexios, Gary, & Kate are all okay with renaming contentIdentifier to gitoid; acknowledging that 
  * this is following the pattern of what was done with PackageURL
  * other content identifiers exist and are supported today in SPDX 3 (see ExternalIdentifiers)
  * a more generic contentIdentifier solution could be considered in future releases
  * and we didn't want this to hold up the release of RC2 and believe a more thorough discussion is needed
* reviewed the security model diagram compared to the model to identify any other changes necessary
  * discussed whether lifecyclescopedrelationship is needed for the security profile and decided that we should model and create examples before we make any changes to the security profile, acknowledging that moving this to be a subclass of lifecyclescopedrelationship would not be a breaking change in a future release
  * It's not clear how to specify Relationship restrictions. Currently they are documented as constraints in the text of the markdown file's Description. We need to wait to make a change when the parser handles it. Jeff added a comment to Issue #522 to capture the specific scenario discussed: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/522#issuecomment-1945200156
