# SPDX Security Team Meeting - April 24, 2024

## Attendees
* Rose Judge
* Jeff Scutt

## Agenda
* VEX examples - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/933 - clarify how to change a VEX status

## Notes
#### General review for VEX Annex
* How  do we denote a changing status? i.e. under investigation --> affected
  * Previously discussed an "amends" relationship between the old and new VEX vuln relationships but Adolfo [says](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/933#discussion_r1576507417) this is an edge case and instead simply issue a new vex statement using vexVersion
  * J.2: Issue a new statement and include an amends relationship with blurb that says this is not mandatory however it will increase value for parsing these documents by providing context and a "paper trail" of status changes
  
* Add Intro paragraph
  * This is VEX, here are the core concepts, providing appropriate links
  * Add: In order to implement vex in SPDX you must know (triad)
   Need clarity on how the software product relates to SPDX. Don't need an SBOM to implement vex - can just use the triad and assemble statements this way. Value of SBOM is that if one pulls vuln feeds to any CVE for anything in that SBOM, better portrayal of risk (esp using VEX)

* For changing VEX statuses:
 - Clarify what is the recommended way to do it + why even though there are multiple ways it can be implemented ("amends" relationship vs just dangling new VEX vuln relationship)
 - amends relationship makes it easy 
 
* Also add:
  * Details on how to interpret/use `assessedElement`
    * Can use when a vulnerability affects child element/component of the software product
      * In the mechanics: two `assessedElement`s both pointing to log4j but only one is affected and the other is not affected. Add this info under "assembling vex statements" header
  * Clarify linking vs embedding
