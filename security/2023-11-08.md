##  Notes
### Approve 10/25 meeting PR:
* https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/572
* Approved
  
### Review Security Relationships
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/548/files - general relationship PR that touches a few security relationships
* Rose has proposal PR for other security relationships: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/550
* Need to clarify where to put additional properties on relationships that come with specific relationship types (i.e. `hasAssessmentFor`)

### CISA KEV use case
* How would this be modeled using current relationships?
* A CVE is a KEV or not a KEV
  * Indicates that a CVE MUST be fixed to sell product to the government because it has been observed being exploited in the wild.
  * Should this be a property or assessment relationship?
