## Security Identifier Proposal

  - Proposal at
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WfArS8_xR_CQ_5plOOMtj1y9ps5M-gXFjofUBXR8hyE/edit#>
  - Proposal for an SPDX Item level property to hold a reference to an
    external database for packages
  - Discussion on how much duplication of other efforts
      - Proposal to only provide a link to the other efforts (using a
        common ID, e.g. CPE) and not duplicate any of the effort
  - Do we want a special section dedicated to vulnerability information
    or do we want it broader?
  - Discussion on the two proposals for external systems references
      - General need for referencing external systems
      - Proposal that there should be one solution
      - Concern that the CPE/SWID is different from the repositories and
        should be a different schema
  - Discussion on tag/value and RDF representations
      - For tag/value - need to be a single string for the package
        reference
      - RDF can either be a single string reference or could be a more
        general class model
          - Gary to propose a follow-up after doing some research
  - Proposal for a table with the following columns:
      - prefix
      - URL for database or definition of the external reference
      - Checkbox if the syntax is validated by the SPDX
      - ABNF format if syntax is to be validated
      - Domain - could be checkboxes for each domain covered (e.g.
        security, asset management)
  - Is this at the item level or at the package level?
      - Other than hardware, all of the external references reference
        something we would describe as a package in SPDX terms
      - There is an issue when we have a binary file which represents a
        package and that package is described by an SPDX document - we
        would like to have a way to reference the external package
        without requiring the full SPDX package information (which may
        not be available)
      - There is a proposal for external package references in bugzilla
        (bug 1298
        <https://bugs.linuxfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1298>)
      - Agree to decide package or item level after the external package
        reference proposal is discussed next week
