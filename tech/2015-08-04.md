    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTgrEKBlza_U3yZBKpgu9JDYhZkZ6Jbj9jNsmRreCMo/edit#heading=h.aawyob9p29xu>
  - Discuss use cases
      - Maven repository dependency reference
  - Discussion on approach - should we define a new section for external
    package or create a new property for package "external"?
      - Advantage of external flag - won't need to add a new section
      - Advantage of two sections (external package and current package
        definition) - can create a schema that can be validated for the
        mandatory and optional fields
      - Agree to investigate an approach we have a section for common
        package elements and two subsections for the specific elements
        of an internal (current package definition) and external
        package.
      - Yev will post a spreadsheet showing the different cardinalities
        of the package properties between the internal and external
        packages.
