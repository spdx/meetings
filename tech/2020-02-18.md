## Joint legal/tech call

  - Feedback from the meeting at FOSDEM was adding the ability to add
    licenses
      - There was a project last year that still needs to be deployed
      - Discussion having a non-curated or semi-curated license list
      - Steve proposed having a joint call with legal
      - Issue <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/113> tracks last
        year’s proposal
      - Hashing of names proposed
      - Concern with hashing, two licenses match, but end up with 2
        different ids, as they hash differently. Namespace approach from
        Mark Atwood avoids issue, avoids the duplicate license text
        being represented with multiple license ids
      - William raised the advantage of hashing allows for offline use
      - Philippe mentioned 1000+ additional licenses could be added
      - William suggested an aliasing approach to resolve duplicate
        licenses
      - Need a PR to specify the proposal
          - Kate agreed to write up the spec
