## Snippets

  - Draft proposal from Kate
    (https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OknzNnY56UZhnj\_VVPatirBrNze5cWXDx2fnKbBI\_g)
  - Should we support snippets in an SPDX document that refer to files
    contained outside the SPDX document?
      - Downstream edits of SPDX document use cases - probably good to
        have copy of the file
      - Since it always have to refer back to a file, we should require
        a copy of the file
      - Leaning towards requiring the file to be present in the same doc
        for a snippet
  - Name is not required
      - Requires a change to the model
      - Could we make in optional?
          - Can we distinguish that in RDF
      - Would need to update tools
      - Snippet naming left open, use a proposal
          - Need a proposal on how the name would be proposed
          - Could be nothing, optional or mandatory
          - jQuery UI use case - "button" is generated
  - Discussion on including snippets for files not included in the SPDX
    document
      - Needs to be present in some SPDX document - may require adding
        the file to the SPDX Document
      - Need to document the requirement
  - Line numbers - left open - pick up conversation

## Review SPDX Identifier wiki page

  - Inconsistent use of ID and Identifier - Agreed to make it consistent
    using Identifier since that is being used primarily by the early
    adopters.
