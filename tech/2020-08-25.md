## Call with OpenChain Automotive Workgroup

  - Thomas attended a meeting with the OpenChain Automotive Workgroup
  - Led my Endo-san
  - Proposal to create an automotive profile
  - Created a PR: PR \#468 <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/468>
  - Several updates are in progress for the PR
  - Several enhancements to 3.0 requested
      - Need a product entity
      - Need a condition entity
      - Need defects
          - Defects go against conditions
      - Which product is involved
      - Where in the lifecycle (e.g. prototype)
  - Questions on scope
      - Initial proposal would use SPDX for specifications
        communications back to supplier
      - Should that be in scope for SPDX?
  - Discussion on defects
      - Should we expand vulnerabilities to include functional defects,
        others?
      - Thomas suggested vulnerabilities are very similar to other types
        of defects
      - Relationship to patches
  - Desire to communicate document expiration or other way to include
    the concept of time
      - Should we have a time profile?
      - Stating a future expectation like “I will release a new version
        on xxx” may violate the principle of stating facts
      - would like to avoid modeling contractual relationship
  - Audience – who is the intended recipient?
      - Example OEM supplier may document information which is not
        intended to be communicated to end users
      - Steve suggested that the process used for communicating
        documents may provide the mechanism for what is communicated to
        whom

## Identity

  - Came out of the 3T SBOM comparison to SPDX
  - Current SPDX identity is a structured string (e.g. PERSON: (email))
  - Proposal to structure this as a separate class in SPDX 3.0 using
    person, organization and tool as subclasses
      - name and email would be properties
      - There may have been an identity type in the linking profile
          - Nisha will check with Santiago
  - Nisha asked if there was a process to propose promoting a field from
    a profile to the base profile
      - Those proposals can be raised in the SPDX tech meeting
      - Wait until we see commonalities between profiles before
        promoting
      - This could be used for identity properties used in linking
        profile and perhaps vulnerabilities
  - No concerns about adding structure to the identity

## Vulnerability Profiles

  - 3T SBOM put vulnerabilities in the defects
  - Thomas presented the 3T defects spec
      - Similar structure to SPDX
      - Additional relationships
  - Proposal to use defects rather than vulnerabilities
  - Question on having defect types or subclasses
  - Could use different profiles for security defects vs. other types of
    defects
  - DefectRepsonse
      - Not necessarily a fact like a defect is a fact
      - Should have a relationship to defect
      - Examples – isAffectedBy – this would be a relationship and more
        fact based
  - Should state SPDX 3.0 design principles
      - Could start with the spec statements about scope for SPDX 2.2
  - Should Vulnerabilities be their own element or a “type” of defect?
  - Source – specify the source
      - Rating is likely related to the source
      - Suggestion to move the rating to the source
      - Score may change over time
      - Vulnerability creation time may be different than document
        creating time
      - From Peter: CVSS has an equation under the hood -
        Weight\_for\_base \* base + weight\_for\_impact \* impact + ….
  - Dependency Tree Profile proposal

## Next Week

  - SPDX 3.0 design principles (e.g. facts based, scope related)
  - Dependency Tree Profile proposal – or template
