## Update from LF Leadership Summit

  - Discussed license namespace and repository proposals
      - Agreed to divide the problem into separate namespaces and
        repositories
      - 3 use cases:
          - “Private” namespace for license ID’s used within the same
            company
          - “Public” namespaces for external repositories of open source
            licenses which may eventually move into the listed licenses
          - “NonOSS” ability to create license references for licenses
            that do not meet the criteria for open source licenses and
            may never be added to the SPDX license list
      - Proposal from leadership summit was to allow 2 namespaces
          - A DNS based namespace which must have a DNS registered
            domain name behind it. These namespaces would not need to be
            registered in any repository (but could be)
          - A free format namespace that would need to be registered
            someplace to avoid name collisions
      - Syntax for the namespaces were proposed to be:
          - ‘LicenseRef-.\[dns-style\] where \[dns-style\] is the naming
            convention proposed by Mark Atwood
          - ‘LicenseRef—\[freeformat\] where \[freeformat\] is text that
            complies with the LicenseRef syntax
      - Discussion on the syntax
          - General displeasure was expressed on the syntax (confusing,
            prone to typos)
          - Current constraints on the naming led to this proposal
              - Ability to easily determine if the license ref refers to
                a namespace and be able to determine which type of
                namespace it is
              - Parseable by the current tools for LicenseRef (e.g.
                comply with the syntax for LicenseRef’s specified in the
                2.1 spec)
      - Alternative syntaxes were discussed
          - No constraint on the text – if the text isn’t a listed
            license, it would be considered a namespace
          - Instead of LicenseRef-, preceed the namespaces by something
            else unique (e.g. ‘@’).
          - Use something other than a . or – after the LicenseRef (e.g.
            LicenseRef-DNSName-\[dns-style\])
  - Discussed the Repository options
      - Do we need anyting complex? Can we just have people drop their
        namespaces into a git repo?
          - Legal team expressed concern about licenses matching
            licenses on the license list being added and duplicated.
            This would require some checks and automation to solve
            efficiently.
      - Kate will follow-up with Mark Atwood to get the written proposal
        so that we can discuss further next week.
