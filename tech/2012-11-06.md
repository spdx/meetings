## Modeling

  - Discussed approach – could do a more formal domain model followed by
    model, or we could start with existing proposal. General consensus
    to start with the existing proposal.
  - Proposal to review existing model to see which use cases are
    supported
  - Agreed to create a spreadsheet with the columns being the 3
    proposals + the existing model and the rows being the use cases
  - Kate volunteered to create and post the initial spreadsheet
  - Review and discussion of the merged model and Peter’s model
  - Next step – Kate will publish the initial spreadsheet to the Wiki
