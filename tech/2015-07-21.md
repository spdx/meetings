## Package External Identifiers

  - Motivation: allows easy reference to other package metadata by
    referring to other identifiers
  - Added CPE - Vulnerability information from NIST
  - Proposal Google docs at:
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6LWnkh5GbMV9Xo5_zJ0wTNLROEIa4o1OU279YueI90/edit>
  - Should this be a field at a file level as well?
      - Could be handled as a package relationship from the file and
        have the file contain the external identifier
      - Would be simpler to have the field at the file level
      - Discussion on the relationship between package external
        identifiers, artifactOf, and external packages
      - Agreed that we would have this be a package level definition for
        now - a file level external identifier would make sense, but
        would be a separate proposal
  - Discussion on whether we include CPE or include that in a separate?
      - Table the discussion until after the security proposal
      - There may be a separate security section
  - Should it be package identifier or something more generic (e.g.
    external identifier)?
  - Should it only refer to source code locations or should it be more
    general?
      - Agree to have general references (need to take into account
        security which will be discussed after the security proposal)
  - Should we replace the "/" with something more distinct (e.g. double
    colon "::")
  - Relationship to other fields need to be defined
      - download location - Example where both download location and
        external ID
      - home page
  - Bill will update the proposal based on today's discussion
