## Agenda

### Potential Discussion topics
- Issue 630: Consider extensibility for package "file" types
- Integrity Method related issues and PR’s – Issue 595,
- Issue 561: Add Software Level of Support property to Software Package
- Issue 522: Expressing conformance constraints – should this be moved to 3.1?

## Notes
### RDF status:  
* Prototype of how RDF & SHACL look like is WIP.   Current RDF is fairly arbitrary.
* Alexios walked through his prototype with various examples.   Issues?
* Joshua:   Been prototyping using the SHACL/RDF output.   Need node type for datatype to enforce they are literals. 
* Sean: for datatype property, assert IRI and class,  then add value and cardinality constraints. 
* Alexios: Would like this input in written to double check.  
* Sean: Every property should have a node path and either a literal or type specified (sh:class).  Should have an SH Nodekind - to be SH:IRI.   Joshuah:  Need to be careful in that there are some blank nodes.   We can restrict elements to be IRIs.    
* Joshua asserted in chat that need to be sh:BlankNodeOrIRI I think to allow blank nodes
* Alexios edited his RDF/SACHL model information during the call, to incorporate feedback from Sean & Joshua.
* Sean what about the "optional others"?   Joshua: would like to see patterns. 
* Joshua,  datatype properties looked fine, didn't have to make any changes.   We're inherity from OWL and using the types, but not using Axioms.   Sean:  This will let folks extend in the future. 
* Alexios: reviewed vocabulary.   Sean discussed different approaches, and this formal way, will force use of an extension (vs string approach).   What is done here makes sense.   Gary prefers the constrained individuals for efficiency of tools.   No objection to using individuals.
* Alexios - datatypes are still to be generated.  Typical one will be pattern on a string.  
* Sean - can also define a datatype for strings.   There is a prebuilt mechanism for RDF
* Discussion on datetype and strings.  Clarified can can have SHACL constraints on both.  Resolves pull request https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/661
    
### SPDXID - PR#662
* When serialization sees this,  it's showing up as @id.   Object doesn't have SPDXID type.   
* Joshua declared it as a mapping for @id.  So doesn't generate for SPDXID field. 
* Alexios preference is to hardcode SPDXID, rather than introduce new concept.
* Joshua points out creation info.
* Discussion on elements having ids, and how to handle blank nodes without ids.  (which would be IRIs).
* Gary giving his vote to Joshua next week.      Alexios to lead up discussion on RDF/OWL next week. 
* We will also discuss on the serialization call this Thursday

### SPDX 3.1
* Preference is to create a 3.1 branch for some of the other profiles.   (ie. operations will be ready for wider review )

### SPDX-Lite
* Joshua was on call and can help bridge.   Asia team wanted to work in Seattle.
