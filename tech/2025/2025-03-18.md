## Agenda

## Notes

- Reviewed changes related to location and requirements from Hardware Profile
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/977
- No decisions were made
- RP will be posted this week

### Location

- Location is an abstract class. Currently has two concrete classes: PhysicalLocation and DigitalLocation
  - What should be inside this abstract class? Should a country be a mandatory field in both Physical and Digital Locations?
- Physical Location and Digital Location terms are from GS1 standard (widely used in logistics and for barcodes)
- GS1 GLN location is a unique ID issued by GS1
  https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gln
- In the enum, there is also "MailingLocation" which is considered a "hybrid" type, as a mailing location can be both Physical and Digital/Virtual (like emails?)
  - Art question: Can we use MailingAddress or PostalAddress (same name with Schema.org type) instead? https://schema.org/PostalAddress. To differentiate between "location" and "address". A location is a unique point in space. An address is a calling of a location. A location can have multiple valid addresses (full street address, PO Box, famous building name that a full street address can be omitted).

### Requirements

- Need discussions with FuSa (functional safety) Profile WG and potentially other WGs as well.
- There can also be a software requirement.
- Likely we need this in the Core (or a shared) Profile

### Hazard/Harm/Risk types

- Hardware Profile proposes hazard types
  - Harms is a sunset of Hazards?
- AI Profile 3.0 has safety risk level types
  https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/AI/Vocabularies/SafetyRiskAssessmentType/
- EU AI Act has 4 risk categories
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/650

### Standards

- Standards discussions
- Hardware Profile proposes StandardAndSpecification class
- Core Profile 3.0 has standardName property
- AI Profile WG interested in standards. Already has standardCompliance property.
- Standard class https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/387
- Relationship between standardName and standardCompliance properties
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/893
- This also likely to be in the Core (or a shared) Profile

### Naming

- ModifyAction looks very similar to ChangeAction. May need a better name.
  - ModifyAction is action that made a spatial difference to an object. Talking something in or out of an object (change). Moving an object (transport).

### Change of Ownership/Custody

- Hardware Profile has "buyer" and "seller" properties, which may related to SoftwareProvider class in Arrive Profile
