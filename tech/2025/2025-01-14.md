## Notes
- FOSDEM: meetup after SBOM Devroom - Alexios, Art, Henk, Kate will be there.
- Henk - pointed out definitions of process are out there, re: plan process; recipe, etc.    A specified procedure should be considered.  Functional Design Assurance is focusing on methodology and idea of plans and different nature of processes.
- Art points to ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 Information technology - Top-level ontologies (TLO) - Part 2: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
- PR is https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/947
  - Alexios points out "version" is being overloaded in PR. 
  - Discussion of properties from walk through  (length, width, height, unit and all from elements)
    Possibly makes sense to put within an object.    Dimensions are properties of a physical thing.
    Discussion to move HBOM Physical class into "Physical Hardware"
  - Some question as to what does "Batch" mean for virtual hardware. Batch definition needs to be defined.
  - Is there a case where lots of virtual hardware instances are generated through same process?
    That might be where batch could be used. 
  - Virtual Hardware definition use simulation or emulation of hardware.  
  - Virtual Hardware is a hardware element (was artifact, which was confusing). 
  - Discussion on whether it should be an Artifact (rather than just an element). 
- Quantity-Unit
  - Unit was added as cm, meter, feet, inches, etc.  so should be defined.
    Possibly options will be restricted to an enumeration.
  - Request to use a vocabulary - with restricted enumerations.  ISO standard needs to considered.
  - Quantity issue scheme - dictionary record
  - The Schema.org has something about Distance, Duration, Energy, Mass
     https://schema.org/Quantity, https://schema.org/Mass
  - Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types (QUDT) Schema / QUDT Ontologies https://www.qudt.org/
  - The Unified Code for Units of Measure https://ucum.org/ucum
  - Currently, AI Profile also has Quantity-Unit property pair for energy consumption
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/model/AI/Classes/EnergyConsumption.md
    {
      "type": "ai_EnergyConsumptionDescription",
      "ai_energyQuantity": "36.5",
      "ai_energyUnit": "kilowattHour"
    }
    - Does it possible to come up with a new DataType for Quantity-Unit pair? That will be generic for requirements in AI, Hardware, etc.
- Hardware taxonomy/ontology
  - MODULE-IDENTITY, mib-2
