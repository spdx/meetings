## Agenda
- TEA Protocol  - https://github.com/CycloneDX/transparency-exchange-api
- GoLang

## Minutes

### GoLang
- We can explore OpenSSF funding for GoLang - possibly Python, follow-up with Kate
- Brandon will take a look at the GoLang language bindings and follow-up with Keith
- Brandon won't have time to help implement SPDX 3

### TEA protocol
- OWASP Transparency Exchange API
- A.K.A. project Koala
- Reference: CISA SBOM Sharing - Koala targeting high sophistication
- Even though it is in the CycloneDX workgroup, it is not CycloneDX specific
  - Would like to make sure it works with SPDX
- API based on discovery scheme - URN called a Transparency Exchange Identifier
- Working on Insights for query in phase 2
- TEI - identifier, not locator
- Use standard DNS resolution
- Vendor defines a TEI
- One product can have more than on eTEI
- Collaborating with SCITT
- Bob: Can we have an internal TEA server that doesn't publish everything publicly
  - Ollie: Likes the idea, may end up being an implementation guide outside the core spec
- OWASP Common Lifecycle Enumeration: Tracks support lifecycle (e.g. end of life, supported)
- Status:
    - Discovery spec is pretty stable
    - Beta version of the API targeted for the end of this quarter
    - Target hackathon at the end of May - in Barcelona event - OWASP Global Appsec Europa
- Targeted to be an ECMA standard
- Brandon: How can we participate
  - Olle is available via chat
  - Would like more people to look at the API spec
  - Especially as it comes to the collection - how do we determine the type?
  - Brandon interested in collaborating
- Dick Brooks: Artifact collections - CSAF advisories?
  - Olle: Yes
- Bob: Suggest supporting SPDX profiles
- Olle: Can use internet media types as well
- Transparancy logs are needed
- Questions at FOSSDEM - how do we trust the vendors don't change the SBOMs?
- Updating the collection - need ENUM
- Dick: Question on EU regulations related to verifying SBOMs 
  - Ollie: Difference between politicians creating regulations and technical design / implementations
- Brandon: im curious to what the considerations are in terms of reusing PURL for products URIs vs creating TEI?
  - OWASP adopting to include commercial packages
  - Does not include locations
  - TEI can include the package URL
  - TEI is used for the web service
    - Includes a product identifier and URL
- Dick: SCITT demonstrated a "discovery artifact" called a Vendor Response File with links to artifacts, available in a SCITT Trust Registry: https://energycentral.com/c/iu/international-trust-registry-demonstration-success
- Gary: Are collections immutable?
  - Ollie: Currently not a requirement, but Ollie supports making them immutable
- Gary: How constrained is the "collections"?  How granular?
  - Ollie: Need to have extensions so we don't have to go through the standards board
    - File types - can accept anything with Internet media types ("MIME") - like application/pdf
- We'll schedule a follow-up discussion with Ollie in a future SPDX call to discuss mapping to SPDX collections
  - e.g. do we create TEI identifiers that map to SPDX documents or go more granular and map to individual elements
