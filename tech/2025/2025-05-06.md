## Notes

### Administrative
- **Minutes from previous meeting approved.**

---

### Regulation Class Discussion

- Debate on subclassing: `Element` vs `Artifact` vs `Specification`
- **Decision:** Regulation will be a **subclass of Specification**

#### Regulation Reference
- Dick: Regulations commonly cited with structured references (e.g., US CFR Title 18 Part 208)

#### Conformance and Relationships
- Conformance should be modeled as a **relationship**, not as part of the Regulation class
- Discussion: Add `conformsTo` as new value in the `RelationshipType` vocabulary  
  - **Decision:** Add `conformsTo` as new `RelationshipType`
- Discussion of adding a softer type of relationship (e.g., relevance without full conformance)
- Considerations for "self-conformance" (e.g., OpenChain)
- Distinction between:
  - `conformsTo`: implies meeting conformance criteria
  - intent to conform: not yet fulfilled

#### Additional Info in Relationships
- Need a new **subtype** of Relationship to hold extra metadata
- Should **not** use `RelationshipCompleteness` to represent conformance level
  - It refers to **completeness of the relationship itself**, not quality of conformance

- Example model:  
  [VulnAssessmentRelationship](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Security/Classes/VulnAssessmentRelationship/)

### SPDX 2.3 Spec – New Relationship Proposal

- Rose: Asked whether a new relationship type can be added to SPDX 2.3
- Gary: No plans for a 2.4 release at present
- Discussion needed
- Possibility:
  - Add relationship to SPDX 3.X first
  - **Backport** to 2.X if needed
