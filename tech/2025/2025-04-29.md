## Notes

### Admin
- **Minutes of 2025-04-22 approved.**

---

### OMG Update
- [SPDX 3.0 OMG Specification published](https://www.omg.org/spec/SPDX/3.0)

---

### Regulation Class Discussion

- From previous meeting: use **relationship** (not property) to link conformance between elements/artifacts.  
- Current topic: how to encode supporting **evidence** and documentation.

**Discussion Points:**
- Should it be a lifecycle-scoped relationship?
- Should we allow **relationship to a relationship**?
- **Regulation** should be a **subclass of Artifact**.
- Proposal: Regulation → subclass of **Specification** → subclass of **Artifact**

---

### “Mandatory” Property Debate
- A regulation being "mandatory" may depend on **context**.
- More feasible: Indicate if a **Specification** is formal.

---

### External Identifier / Reference
- Discussion: Should `externalId` or `externalReference` be **required**?
- Already defined in `Artifact` class (but not mandatory).
- References:
  - Dick: ANSI X12 purchase order standards.
  - Arthit: [ELI – European Legislation Identifier](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/eli-european-legislation-identifier-eurlex)

**Insight:**  
- "External" refers to identifiers external to SPDX, which can still be internal to an organization.
- Suggestion to define URI schemas for common bodies (e.g. IETF, W3C, ISO, etc.)

---

### Consumer vs Producer Needs
- Gary: Consumers want complete metadata; Producers may struggle to supply it.  
- **Risk:** If a required property is missing, Producers might omit entire class.
- Gary: **Some information > No information**

---

### Location / Jurisdiction
- Karen: Required for AI-related regulations (e.g. EU AI Act).
- Arthit: Export control is another relevant case.

---

### Versioning & Specification Hierarchies
- Art (via chat): Need to track versioning lineage between specifications.
- Helps assess compatibility and conformance implications.

---

### Specification Type
- Two proposals:
  - Have Regulation as a **subclass of Specification**
  - OR define `type` as an **enum property** of `Specification` (e.g. `"Regulation"`)

---

### Definitions and Conceptual Hierarchies
- Dick: US CFR provides examples of regulation definitions.
- Karsten: Sees **Specification** and **Regulation** as siblings.
- SPDX itself is a **Specification**, not a Regulation.

**Tentative Hierarchy:**
- Artifact → Specification  
- Artifact → Regulation  
- **Specification ≠ Regulation** (not subclassed)

---

### Next Steps
- Revisit **Regulation modeling** next week  
- Discuss **pros/cons** of the structural approaches
