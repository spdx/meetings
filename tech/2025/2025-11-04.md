## Notes

* **ISO submission:** Word document submitted to LF; under review and expected to be forwarded to ISO this week along with required materials.
* **RDF IRIs:** Issue closed and sufficient for ISO submission. Additional tooling and CI work remains — see [Issue #1246](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1246).

  * Tooling context file adjustments will be included in the next patch release (3.0.2).
* **Glossary PR:** Updated in [PR #1294](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1294).

  * During transition from SPDX 2.x to 3.0, glossary shifted from specific definitions to ISO references.
  * Need to clarify SPDX-specific use of terms, as ISO definitions are often multiple or ambiguous.
  * Recreating glossary entries for SPDX 3.1, with possible backport if ISO requests revisions to 3.0 submission.

## Future Meeting Topics

* **3.0 or 3.1:** Introducing digital/cryptographic signatures to the model — [Issue #1065](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1065)
* Version series license families
* Clarify `hasDeclaredLicense` and `hasConcludedLicense` — [Issue #1022](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1022)
* Update from and add to type of `hasConcludedLicense` and `hasDeclaredLicense` — [PR #1122](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1122)
* Add “known unknown” and “redacted” properties to elements for CISA minimum elements — [Issue #1105](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1105)
