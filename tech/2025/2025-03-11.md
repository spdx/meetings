## Notes

- Python Packaging
  - Need to publish the python packages to PyPI because you can't publish if it references another package in Git
  - This will allow other people to package stuff with spdx tools
  - Don't want to wait for SPDX Organization account approval on PyPI because it took a long time (we can migrate the package to the Organization account once we got it)
  - Should add multiple owners to the python packages
- Existing tools-python is published on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/spdx-tools/

- Location (Hardware/Steven)
  - Current proposal fron Hardware Profile WG put Location as a common class in Core
  - Location has two subclasses: Physical Location and Digital Location
  - Discussion on should Location be an Element (can have relationship) or a Non-Element (as a value for property)
  - Non-Element/property approach is simpler and looks like cover use cases
  - Argument about reusability; Relationship has a flexibility when Element changes.
  - A question if Location changes often. For example, in case of changes in supply chain/logistics.
  - Software as a Service Profile WG uses property
  - Relationship can be external and the linked Element can be in another SPDX document
  - A use case that needs the Location as property: recording the address/location of an action - don't want it to changed after it get recorded
  - A property value can be Element as well; We can have Location as an Element, and it can be use with either property or relationship
  - locationTime will be optional; Will need a better name
    - "locatedAtTime", "pointInTimeLocation", "validLocationAtTime" ?
  - Should we required CountryCode. Gary use cases need that. Arthit argues about region (EU vs non-EU, for example) which is not exactly a country

- UnitOfMeasure (Hardware/Steven)
  - Question on suitable name other that "Unit of Measure"
    - "QuantityMeasurement" ?
  - Gary suggests to resolve this in a joint call between Hardward AI Profile WGs (and other teams)

- ServiceProvider (SaaS/Gary)
  - ServiceProvider is no longer a separated class

- SHACL (Ilans)
  - There are something that not currently a requirement but may be useful to have it as a SHACL rules, for example in license use case. Will discuss next week.

- Branch to keep track changes for ISO (Gary)
  - Bob: Need to keep track of it

## Next Week

- Update for the localization:
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1169
- Branching strategy for any updates required for ISO:
