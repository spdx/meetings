## Notes
- Minutes approved  
- **QUDT ontology for units and quantities (#1149)**  
  - Reuse what is already available and complete  
  - May need extra property for formula, increasing validation work  
  - SHACL validation can ensure namespace alignment  
  - String properties difficult to validate  
    - Possibly use a decimal for validation and a free-form string for display  
  - Used by AI and Supply Chain profiles  

- **Reuse (#1155)**  
  - Geo location in `Core/PhysicalLocation`; open a specific issue  
  - Digital Product Passport:
