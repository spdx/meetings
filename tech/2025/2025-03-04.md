## Agenda

- Operations Profile (Marcel & Ummo)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/959
- Software as a Service Profile (Gary)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/973
- Gary (on Service Profile): "One specific area to review is the geographic information.
  Is this property something which should be in core and shared with other profiles?"

## Notes

### Operations Profile

- Goal is to decide the business context
- Went through background slides
- Draw.io version will be added after the current PR
- Use cases: Export control, obligation assessment, license compliance, upstream contribution
  - Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) standardised field
- Some of the assessment relationships may better belong in Core?
- Operation Assessment Relationship was based off of security 
- Request for creating an example of how to use the new classes - Marcel agrees, and would like to see this on the other profiles as well. (Request is to put it into https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples)
- Gary: There is a related activity in a CISA tiger team - "CISA System of SBOM" - led by John Cavanaugh <johncavanaugh@iis-corp.com>
- Note: Delivery should probably be an Artifact rather than a relationship.
- Should Crypto be included in operations profile?
  Alexios, IBM, pick up discussion on Crypto contribution.
- Agree that should be merged into `spdx:profile-operations` branch, then clean up before merging into `develop`.

### Services Profile

- Subgroup believes done at this point.
- PR available for merging to `develop` branch
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/973
- Presentation
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lhhG2j3JxU2M-Lkk8gLlT7xlt5H7I-O9tJe2OKm_FnI/edit?usp=sharing
- Services profile, work with OpenChain, focus around cybersecurity of infrastructure
- Use cases: Data governance (according to regulatory compliance), Supier infra governance, Service availablity
  - These use cases can be overlap
  - Data classificaiton is something already in Dataset Profile, we may need to discuss
    - "Country of origin" is not in the Dataset profile yet
- ServiceProvider as a subclass of Agent, SoftwareService as a subclass of Element, and there are relationship between them
- Another use case: Authentication
- Discussion about "country code", currently it use ISO 3166-1 alpha-3:
  - A question if it is possible for SPDX author to use another standard for the country/terriotry enumeration.
  - For example, using a 2-alphabet country code, or using a country code standard with different agreements on a categorisation of a region
- Should "location" also include IP address?
  - Joshua: We should not overload the meaning of a property
  - Schema.org has https://schema.org/VirtualLocation type
- Currently Operations Profile draft country code use alpha-2, but ok to use alpha-3
- DECISION:  is to go to CountryCodeAlpha3 for country code simple data type and put it in Core Profile.
  - Adjust PR to reflect its in Core Profile
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/985
- Alfred:  Is a software provider an Agent or a Tool?
  - Provider takes on more of legal issues.  It's close to an organization in terms of nature.
    Service is performing Task, which is a subclass of Element.
- Ilan:  How handle the API being accessible as service?   Create service object, and then denote the agent providing the API would be the service provider.   For example: NPM and pulling a package?  NPM is a service, and then reference it.
- Would also include a relationship of "Service Provided by" (Gary to check and see if need to add to PR)
