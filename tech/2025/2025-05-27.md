### Discussion: Taxonomy Type for Hardware
- `Taxonomy` class introduced in Hardware Profile  
  - [PR #1027](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1027)  
- `Taxonomy` may also apply to different types of safety risk assessments in the AI Profile  
  - See [Issue #650](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/650)  
  - Example: “high” in EU General Risk Assessment ≠ “high” in EU AI Act  
- Proposal to rename `Taxonomy` to `DefinedType` and move it to the Core Profile  
  - `Core/DefinedType`  
- Hardware WG to discuss internally, update diagrams, and create a new PR  
- Proposed: remove `DefinedHazard` and replace with `DefinedType`  
- AI Profile to use `DefinedType` moving forward
