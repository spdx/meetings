## Notes

### Profile Team Backlog
- Request for each profile team to go through backlogs.  
- Mark work-in-progress items as *draft*.  
- Flag items that need to be reviewed.  

### ISO Publication
- **1271:** See documentation in issue.  
- **1270:** PR needed in spec repo to add Intro parameter to spec parser (mkdocs).  
  - Alexios will handle.  
  - Impacts section 8.3.1.2 in core profile.  
  - PR also needed in model repo.  
- **1255:** Will close once Alexios implements change in spec parser (ensuring consistency by default).  
- **1236:** Checking commit references; may have been squashed or refreshed.  
  - License Expression Annex—Art to search and confirm.  
- **1235:** All references must include a source in the text.  
- **1233:** Handled.  
- Reminder: all PRs should be present in 3.0 and dev branches.  

### Relationship Reviews
- Art completed before Kate—acknowledged and appreciated.  
- See [Issue #1114](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1114) and **SPDX 3.1-dev RelationshipType**.  
  - **hasConcludedLicense** missing type—safe to add.  
  - **hasAddedFile, hasDataFile, hasDeletedFile:**  
    - Possible restriction to *File*; description already clarifies restriction.  
    - Joshua suggested *Artifact* may be more appropriate than *File* (as *File* is software).  
    - Consensus: leave as-is to avoid breaking changes, but update documentation.  
    - Typically applies to file or bundle.  
  - For licensing, agreed to expand to allow hardware licensing.  
    - Further discussion needed with legal/compliance teams before restricting scope.  

### Operations Profile
- Review moved to **October 28**.  
- **Next week’s call cancelled.**
