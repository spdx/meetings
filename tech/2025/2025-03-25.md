## Notes

### SPDX 3.0 in OMG

- Formal OMG Spec at this point.
  - Will appear here https://www.omg.org/spec/SPDX
- ISO paperwork can commence
- Do we need a patch release for possible ISO review changes?
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/996
  - Yes, as a placeholder, but won't publish unless needed.

### Dead Links

- Bob will take investigation to Outreach to review for website & sort it.
  - Link to v2.1 HTML version on spdx.dev is 404
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/882
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1122
  - SPDX Schema URL in IANA media type registration entry is dead
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1158

### Python binding

- Binding package moved to PyPI
  - https://pypi.org/project/spdx-python-model/
- The application for PyPI Organization (to be used as the package publisher) is on stale
  - https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/
  - So using personal accounts as publishers until we can have the organization account
- Looking for multiple owners to support Joshua & Arthit - looking for backup owners.

### CRA primer

- OpenSSF Zephyr readiness for EU Cyber Resilience Act
- Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)
  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act
- Joshua: Similar vulnerability handling requirements in regulations regarding devices using radio frequency
- Vulnerability ID is required for reporting/database
- Dick (in chat):
  - SPDX V 2.3 already supports an SBOM with vulnerability reporting information - see appendx K.
  - IEC 29147:2018 is already a requirement for US Federal Government supply chain requirements and NIST Guidance: https://cisa.gov/sag
  - NIST NVD (National Vulnerability Database) is indeed improving https://nvd.nist.gov/
- Cyber Resilience Act Requirements Standards Mapping (from JRC & ENISA)
  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20Requirements%20Standards%20Mapping%20-%20final_with_identifiers_0.pdf
- There are classes of product
- This standard ISO 18031-1:2024 (Common security requirements for radio equipment - Part 1: Internet connected radio equipment) provides requirements looks similar to CRA
- Concerns on compliance for open source projects; Some of the open source repos are not the commercial products
- Need of badge/self-assessment
- Discussion on voluntary reporting requirements?
- What will be counted as a "open source steward"?
- SPDX 3.1 or 3.2 are expected to have fields to capture information for CRA, if not already in 3.0
- NTIA Minimum Requirements and CISA one look like a common baseline
- Software Acquisition Guide for Government Enterprise Consumers: Software Assurance in the Cyber-Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Lifecycle
