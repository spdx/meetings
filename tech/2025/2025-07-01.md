### Feedback from OSS North America
- Attendees: Gary, Kate, Joshua
- Noted strong presence of SPDX in SBOM presentations.
- Tooling remains a weak spot:
  - Need better library support across more programming languages.
  - Dependency-Track currently does not support SPDX. Cautions raised, though integration appears feasible.
