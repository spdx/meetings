## Notes

- Updates:
    - Ilan working on converting issues to PRs,  planed for next week.  

## Include derived classes in Documentation
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1190
     - Illan willing to help this.   Help would be needed in Spec class repo. 
     - Art raised, what should be present in the web site,  useful for part of spec?   Examples were NAK'd by Alexios.
     - Link from documentation?  
     - Website is generated from spec parser.   If not part of spec, doesn't get to website.    Some partial examples are there already - see security & AI profiles have examples.   Please see Alexious comments here https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1012
     - All the derived classes would make it overwhelming.   If we limit it to one level;  might be more tractiable.   Using website technology to selective view.   Illan has ideas on this.   
     - Need Alexios on discussion.
     - General agreement in the call first level down makes sense, and will be helpful. 
     
## Add Regulation class and conformsTo relationship
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1015
  - Some discussion if regulation should be a specification type
  - interpretation of regulation?   More discussion.   
  - Regulatory Authority?
  - ConformsTo - who does the check?   How would exceptions be captured?  
  - Should conforms to be it's own relationship type? 
  - Operations & Safety folk may have opinions here as well.. 
  - Standards compliance profile?   Needing more discuaion. 
  - We may able to use hasDocumentation and hasEvidence relationship type for this?
  - Ilan suggest we model this like we do licenses, with exceptions?   Be able to use similar sort of expression logic. 

## SBOM Examples 
- actually failing, but being marked as passed.
- Need change CI to fix the flow to mark failed properly again.
- Joshua to take a look at CI PR - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/115
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/issues/102 - PR ready - Joshua reviewed.
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/issues/116 - need PR - Gary to investigate
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/issues/117 - need PR - Nisha to investigate
  
## Round Table
- Security Profile restarting.   Rose volunteered to lead.   Ilan interested in participating, next step?    Bob is also interested.  Karsten Klein is interested as well.   Doodle poll for time to meet?
- Others interested in helping with BSI mapping to SPDX - Ilan, Art & Karsten are willing to help. 
- Art is working with John on NTIA conformance checker - will add BSI to this as well.    V3 minimum expectations has been added.    Note that commandline tool is called SBOM-conformance- checker.   Concerns over BSI overshooting for EU CRA act.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pueRxlxoM9n1eG9g6AihjLvybEBTd77m22mRYBQltpg/edit?usp=drivesdk Our mapping of CISA Baseline Attributes. Can use this for BSI work. 
- Karsten - have been looking at different levels of criteria in CRA.  Organizing to different levels of validation of an SBOM?   Looking to beyond the minimum attributes.   Adding in contractual, and other terms.   Going beyond the lower level characteristics.   Heading towards semantics and integrity checks for consistency. 
- Stable tooling in Python is still a gap for Dick.   spdx-python-model is on PyPI now,  and Nisha is using python tooling.   Dick looking for to take to production.   Nisha is finding it stable for generating them.   Challenge on reading and processing them.   Yocto has been using bindings for reading/writing for over a year.   Joshua indicates its converting into python classes natively for serializing and deserializing.  Vulnerability information needed to conform is there.   Validates a subset of stuff.  It doesn't do profile conformance validation.   Enforces strict type, but not semantic per

## Future Meetings
- need to get Operations Profile update.
