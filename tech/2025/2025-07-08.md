### SCITT Presentation (by Jon Geater)
- Overview of **SCITT**: *Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and Trust*  
  - [SCITT Overview](https://scitt.io/)  
  - [IETF WG Info](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about)  
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ietf-scitt)  
- Core concepts: **Identity**, **Claim**, **Evidence**, **Artifact**
- Questions addressed:
  - **Size of output statement**: Relatively small; can use artifact hash.
  - **Input normalization**: Some implementations support it.
  - **Interoperability with SCITT**:  
    - Henk suggested developing a reference or example implementation including SBOMs, VEXs, and VDRs.  
    - Dick noted it would be straightforward to register an SPDX SBOM in JSON format in SCITT.
  - **Identity concerns**:  
    - How to verify "who" someone is?  
    - SCITT supports multiple identity standards via an abstracting API for identity providers.
    - Discussion included which standards are currently supported or planned.
  - **Referencing SCITT from SPDX**:  
    - Possible to include either a URI to transparency data or the full receipt.
  - **SCITT vs. INTOTO**:  
    - INTOTO is considered a separate step in the lifecycle.  
  - **Implementation**:  
    - All current known SCITT implementations use lightweight ledgers (not full blockchains).
- Open Question: Should SPDX define a SCITT integrity method to embed SCITT receipts directly in SPDX documents?
