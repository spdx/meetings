### Notes

#### Approval of Minutes

* Minutes approved.

#### Announcements

* **FOSDEM**
    * Devroom for SBOM and Supply chain expanded to a full day on Sunday.
    * Schedule/talks are still being selected from many submissions.
    * Will be finalized next week – First of Feb. in Brussels. All welcome.
* **GSoC (Google Summer of Code)**
    * SPDX has sponsored its own organization for many years (except last year, where it participated in the Linux Foundation's organization).
    * Open call for people to help mentor and contribute project ideas.

#### In-toto Attestation PR: [https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/508](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/508)

* This PR is to the `in-toto/attestation` repository, not an SPDX repo.
* In-toto currently has an "spdx" predicate.
* Since **SPDX Documents v2** and **v3** have different structures, there should be **two different predicates**.
* A comment was left on the PR to this effect.

#### Operations: Add Operations profile to develop branch [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1172](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1172)

* No objections to merging.
* A number of stylistic/typographic changes were requested by Arthit.
* Action: Commit the requested changes, then merge.

#### Safety: Add Requirements class to Core [https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1177](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1177)

* Work in progress on the PR.
* After merging, there will be a discussion on the generalization of "**rationale**" and maybe "**statement**" so that they can be used by more than one class.

#### Readiness for merging profiles into development

* The **Safety** profile is currently blocked on a renaming discussion. Once resolved, it can be merged.
* Suggestion is to have a more **general systems engineering profile** with specific use cases for Safety and others.
