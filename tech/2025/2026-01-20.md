## Notes

### Approval
- Last week's minutes approved.

### GSoC update
- Talked to Gary. He will be traveling this summer, so no bandwidth to lead/participate.
- Art: If it is related to conformance checker or Python-based, can help.
- No volunteers on call; sending to the mailing list to ask if anyone wants to lead.
- If no responses by Friday, passing.

### Functional Safety and Systems Engineering
- Question: Can we apply something like a "lite" profile for safety?
- What system engineering artifacts are needed to be in safety?
- Challenge: How it can be structured?
- Structured proposal needs to be discussed with wider group.
- Parallel Security and Quality Management profiles may make sense to discuss.
- CRA conformance and Supply chain have impacts here.
- Timing of label changes on grouping of classes.
- Target: Get sorted before -rc2.
- Introduce System Engineering as part of messaging for rc1.

### 3.1-rc1
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1325 - can we move this to RC2? Yes (Art)
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1167 - agreed on call to rc2
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1312 - agreed on call to rc2
- Description of profiles in conformance can be added later:
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/develop/docs/conformance.md
- Conformance points can be added 3.1-rc2.
- TODO: Make sure that issues exist for the new profiles:
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1337
- spec-parser needs to be updated to reflect FunctionalSafety and other new profiles.
- Need writeups of profiles available to describe what 3.1 is going to be.
- Need Supply Chain to have a logo (not blocker; needed for web page).
- Operations needs diagram (and then renaming as appropriate for Functional Safety / System Engineering) (not blocker).
- Examples need to be created for -rc2 (not blocker), especially Knowledge Graph aspect.

#### Contributions requested
- Short SBOM examples and serialization:
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples
- Longer how-to apply SPDX 3 to particular use cases:
  - https://github.com/spdx/using/
  - Website: https://spdx.github.io/using/
- Website: Update all profiles for -rc2.
- Core diagram inaccurate:
  - Art to update
  - Nicole, Steven, and Kate to review
  - then Kate to apply -rc1 tag
  - Tracking issue: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1196
- Please send any profile descriptions to Karen for use for FOSDEM presentation.

### 3.1-rc2

#### Component
- Reviewing for wider applicability to hardware/system engineering implications.
- Question: Can components be their own systems?
- Greg: From SEVOCAB:

  component.
  (1) entity with discrete structure, such as an assembly or software module, within a system considered at a particular level of analysis (ISO/IEC 25019:2023, Systems and software engineering  Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)  Quality-in-use model, 3.1.3)
  (2) one part that makes up a system (IEEE 1012-2024 IEEE Standard for System, Software, and Hardware Verification and Validation, 3.1)
  (3) object that encapsulates its own template, so that the template can be interrogated by interaction with the component (ISO/IEC 10746-2:2009 Information technology -- Open Distributed Processing -- Reference Model: Foundations, 9.26)
  (4) object with a discrete information type that is stored in a component content management system, such as a topic, prerequisite, section, image, or video (ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531:2023 Systems and software engineering -- Content management for product lifecycle, user and service management information for users, 3.1.3)
  (5) product used as a constituent in an assembled product, system or plant (IEC/IEEE 82079-1:2019 Preparation of information for use (instructions for use) of products: Part 1: Principles and general requirements, 3.4)

  Note: A component can be hardware or software and can be subdivided into other components. Component refers to a part of a whole, such as a component of a software product or a component of a software identification tag. The terms module, component, and unit are often used interchangeably or defined to be subelements of one another in different ways depending upon the context. The relationship of these terms is not standardized. A component can be independently managed or not from the end-user or administrator's point of view. See Also: element, unit

### Next week
- Karen working through FOSDEM slides with the group.
