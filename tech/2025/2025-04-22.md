## Notes

### Meeting Platform
- **Deprecating Etherpad** in favor of Google Docs for live minute-taking.
- Final versions will still be stored in **GitHub**.

### PyPI Org for Python Packages
- Need to set up an email (e.g., from `spdx.dev`).
- Decide on appropriate domain.
- Define org membership structure and references.

---

### Reproducible Build Support
- Implementation advice: [Issue #177](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-maven-plugin/issues/177#issuecomment-2819658533)
- Use of [Source Date Epoch](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/)

---

### License Expression: `NOASSERTION` and `NONE`
- Use case around concluded values.
- Can we move `NONE` and `NOASSERTION` to license list?
- Support for license expressions as context strings (cut/paste usability).
- Possible use of `NOLIMITS` designation.
- **Resolution:** Bring up in legal call for review.

---

### JSON Schema & Extensions
- Java libraries not passing validation due to abstract extension types.
- You must define your own type for validation (e.g., `cycloneDX` or custom IRI).
- Abstract class limitation acknowledged.
- **If validation fails, contact Joshua.**
- Plan to move validation guidance into the [USING repo](https://github.com/spdx/using/tree/main/docs)
- Suggestion: Add longform example on how to validate an extension.
- Existing examples: "getting started", "cross-reference".
- Full IRIs required (not in context file).
- Nisha suggested a **one-day SHACL session for implementers.**

---

### `Regulation` Class
- Current discussion: should it be a **relationship** rather than a property?
- Compliance claims ≠ proof/evidence.
- **Working Conclusion:** Use a **relationship**, not an artifact property.

**Follow-up Needs:**
- How to express *evidence* of conformance:
  - Relationship-to-relationship model.
  - Property on relationship.
  - Direct relationship with linked evidence report.

**To Discuss Next Week:**
- Restart with pros/cons of the different modeling approaches.
