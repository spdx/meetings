## Notes

### Hardware Profile Quantity and Unit

- Follow-up on previous discussion - proposal to use outside standard for unit definitions
- QUDT - https://www.qudt.org/
- Very broad approach
- QUDT is the accepted standard
- A few options
  - Reference: Just reference QUDT
  - Extensions: Use the entire QUDT plus add some extensions
    - Define our own vocabulary for the exensions
  - Subset: Present a subset of what's available from QUDT
    - Define our own vocabulary
    - Could also include extensions
- Concern expressed about the complexity of using all QUDT standards
  - Subset approach would work
  - Could have subsets per profile
- Leaning towards implementing subset approach
- Implementation
  - Create an SPDX vocabulary
  - Any individuals from QUDT would use the QUDT individuals
  - If we want to add a measurement that is not in QUDT, we would define it in SPDX - and/or try to get it added to QUDT
  - [Follow-up] - does the spec-parser support this approach?
    - Document how we would represent it in markdown files
  - Propose to take an inclusive approach - only exclude if we're pretty sure it won't be used
- Conclusion: Subset approach
- Profile team defines their own subsets
- [Follow-up] - we need to define a class hierarchy
- Would like to have SHACL rules to validate the subset
- [Follow-up] Do we want to use the QUDT model (e.g. classes and properties)?
  - leaning towards just using the identifiers in the vocabularies
- [Follow-up] How to migrate AI to the subset approach
