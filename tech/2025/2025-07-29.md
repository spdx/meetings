## Notes

### Hardware Profile
- Definitions covered: *Product*, *Supply chain*, and *System and Organization Control (SOC)*.  
- Tool demo: *SysAuditor* scans hardware and produces an SPDX SBOM JSON for both hardware and software.  
- Tool identifies hardware/software roles and compliance artifacts.  
- Joshua suggested `dependsOn` should be lifecycle-scoped (default: runtime).  
- Dictionary key uniqueness clarified — keys are defined in the spec and referenced in the Hardware class.  
- Tool is **not open source** — contact Steven or Alfred for access.  
- "Bundle of bundles" supported.  
- Emphasis: SPDX must support both supply chain and hardware/software BOMs.  
- Future topic: How operations relate when pushing changes.  
- Overlaps in relationship types should be raised as issues or PRs on the Hardware Profile repo.  
- FYI: LF AI’s [Security & Compliance WG](https://github.com/lfai/security-and-compliance)

### ISO Submission & RDF
- New milestones:
  - **3.0.2**: Version submitted to ISO  
  - **3.0.3**: Final ISO version incorporating feedback  
- All 3.0.1 changes must be merged to `develop`.  
- Sync with `develop` to follow 3.0.2 completion.  
- New RDF URI scheme:
  - Exclude patch level (e.g., use `3.0`, not `3.0.1`)  
  - File names will include all 3 version levels  
  - IRI terms must remain stable (2-level), RDF files can be updated (3-level)  
- Multiple RDF files per release OK  
- Patch-level updates are *non-functional* only  
- Tooling upgrade paths from 3.0 → 3.1 expected to be manageable  
- Bob noted some commercial vendors are awaiting library support
