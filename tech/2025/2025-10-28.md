### Operations Profile
- Taking a minimum viable approach to get the ball rolling.  
- Project information includes export control classification number and assessment artifacts.  
- PR is being rebased; merging into profile operations branch, then merged to develop.  
- Limited group reviewing, focusing on export control.  
- Considering a parent class of export class assessment and potential use of the `Annotation` class in core for extension.  
- Previously considered security assessment; deemed too complex for current scope.  
- May call it `export_assessment` to support broader purposes beyond export control.  
- Targeting a PR for the whole branch this weekend.

### Spec Documentation Feedback
- Garmin implementing company-wide compliance and reviewing SPDX.  
- Current spec lacks examples, making it difficult to understand practical application.  
- Suggestion: include examples directly in the spec or link to example repositories.  
- Translation from abstract descriptions to JSON is challenging; every class should ideally include an example.  
- Concern raised about abstract classes — examples should focus on non-abstract ones.  
- Proposed generated solution: link to “using” section to show context and validate document fragments.  
- Two target audiences identified:
  1. Translating from another format.  
  2. Creating new content directly in SPDX.  
- Need clearer concept and definition guidance, examples, and fragments to aid encoding/decoding.  
- Possible approach: create a comprehensive “fake” example, then reference or segment from it.  
- **Resolution:**  
  - Gary to extend the example set.  
  - Joshua to work on translation to HTML.
