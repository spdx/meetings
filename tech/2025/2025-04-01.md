- SPDX logo, trademarks - Kate to follow up with Alexios for spec gen & website version.
- Need list of documents to go to ISO - Alexios to start thread with Jorey, Seth cc: Bob, Gary, Kate

### Tools
- Status of Go Bindings: low level is available.   https://github.com/spdx/spdx-go-model 
- Python bindings are available as well.  https://pypi.org/project/spdx-python-model/
  - Can do basic type validations, but not advanced validations like those relationship-related
- Tools Python & Go - higher level still need to be updated to leverage low level bindings.
- Online Tool supports of SPDX 3.0
  - Compare tool
  - Validate: https://tools.spdx.org/app/validate/ supports 3.0
  - Convert: https://tools.spdx.org/app/convert/ supports “To 3.0” but not “From 3.0”
  - Visual Editor: https://tools.spdx.org/app/dots/ only works with SPDX 3.0
  - Conformance Checker: https://tools.spdx.org/app/ntia_checker/ does not support 3.0

### SHACL
- Ilan went through several of the issues and discussed behavior for validation with Sean
   - NotAffected - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/923, 
      - VEX requirements for not affected are playing a role here: see: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/minimum-requirements-for-vex-508c.pdf 
    - Serveral others were walked through #987, #988, #981, 
- Shifted discussion to where they should be placed.   Separate file or not?
  - Sean recommends not separating unless clear reason why
  - Alexios asks about the end goal for publishing
  - Joshua we're already mixing the ontology and validation in a single file, so would like to see this continue.
  - Considering making a new section that the parser could understand in files already have, or new files?   Easier to prevent them becoming lies, if they are where they are defined.   For cross cutting, may want to have explicit reference.
  - Recommendation to go from issues to go to PRs.
- If it is a Profile-level conformance, put it on the Profile file
  - see: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/model/Build/Build.md#profile-conformance
  - maybe after the Profile Conformance section?  Similarly licensing.
- If defined in one of properties or elements, it should go there.
- When apply multiple places, need to create a special box to put them in,  and should be at the model level.
- Illan will create PRs to a section;  and then the parser will need to be updated.  Have implications on TTL.
- This is going to be targetted for 3.1 (or 3.1.1) not 3.0.1.
- Discussion on biasing towards the normal flow, and keep up the testing. 
- Add "Validation" section into Markdown file, and spec-parser convert it to SHACL rules in TTL file

### Translations
- Art did further research (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1169) If files can be placed in specific folders, the plugin should be able to help us here. 
- For the Spec, we don't have things merged yet,  looking for an example.   See 1141 (Japanese translation).
