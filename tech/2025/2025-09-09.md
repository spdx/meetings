## Notes

### SPDX Feedback for CISA 2025 Minimum Elements
The team reviewed the CISA draft and began preparing a formal response.

* **CISA Resource Page**: [2025 Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/2025-minimum-elements-software-bill-materials-sbom)
* **Public comments are open until October 3, 2025**.
* **SPDX Draft Response**: [SPDX Feedback to CISA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NdHYU_VZtLacD4bEmf2GiUVRTbrcev1beaJpq8s8-pU/edit) (This link is a placeholder for the actual document).

#### Review Discussion Points

* **SBOM Author**
    * Per the SPDX 3.0 spec, the author can be a `Tool` or `SoftwareAgent`.
    * **Discussion**: CISA may require a legal person (Person or Organization). SPDX should recommend that while a `Tool` can be listed, there must be **at least one legal entity** responsible for it.

* **Software Producer**
    * **Discussion**: In an open source context, the `suppliedBy` relationship is often more relevant than `originatedBy`, as the supplier is the one maintaining the software for users. The original author may not be relevant.

* **Component Name**
    * **Discussion**: The document suggests multiple component names may be useful for human readability in different markets. However, PURL is better for unique identification.
    * **Action**: Ask CISA for specific use cases where multiple names provide value.

* **Component Version**
    * **Discussion**: The team raised questions about what to do if there is no previous version and how broadly a "component" is defined.

* **Component Hash**
    * **Discussion**: From the team's experience, file hashes are often more useful than component hashes. What is the intended use case for a component-level hash?

* **License**
    * **Discussion**: How does CISA's proposal account for the nuanced difference between a `hasConcludedLicense` and a `hasDeclaredLicense`, which SPDX 3.0 can already capture?

* **Dependency Relationship**
    * **Discussion**: This could map to several SPDX relationship types, and the direction of the relationship is a critical detail to consider.

The team finished reviewing up to the "Tool Name" section and will continue the discussion offline and in the next meeting.
