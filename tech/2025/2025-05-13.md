## Agenda

- Approve previous minutes  
- Prioritize agenda  

### In-Progress Topics
- [Adding Regulation class (continue)](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1015)  
- [Add naming convention and cardinality to Markdown doc – Approved](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/982)  
- [Suggested changes for `SoftwareService` description – Commented](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1013)  
- [`artifactSize` is added post-3.0.1 but uses 3.0.1 IRI](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.1-dev/model/Software/Properties/artifactSize/)  
  [PR #966](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/966)  
  - Comment: No discussion took place on this agenda item. It appears to stem from confusion about IRI versioning. The spec hasn't officially moved to 3.1, so IRIs still show 3.0.1.

### spdx-examples Follow-Up
- [Approved PRs](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pulls)  
- [PR #109 – Ready to merge](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/109)

### SHACL & Extensions
- SHACL bug for Extension (PR proposed)  
  [Issue Comment](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1017#issuecomment-2822649891)  
- [Allow classes derived from Extension](https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/186)

### SPDX 2.3 Updates
- **New relationships in SPDX 2.3 spec?** (raised by Rose)  

### Legal Review
- [Clarify `hasDeclaredLicense` and `hasConcludedLicense`](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1022)  
  - **Action:** Will be reviewed on an upcoming Legal call.

## Notes
- **Previous minutes were approved.**
- Discussions continued on **Regulation class** and extension-related technical issues.
- Clarification made on IRI versioning—no action taken due to lack of ownership of the `artifactSize` topic.
- Legal input is pending on license property clarification.
