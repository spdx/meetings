## Notes  

### Minutes & Announcements  
- No concerns raised on previous minutes – **approved**.  
- SBOM Use Cases open for input through **June 16**.  
- Dick mentioned EO 2218 from NIST on secure software guidelines.  
  - [Executive Order Language](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/sustaining-select-efforts-to-strengthen-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-amending-executive-order-13694-and-executive-order-14144/)  
  - Removed concept of attestation form; retained CISA portal.  
- Bob needs feedback on **draft cover letter**.  

### Attestation Discussion  
- Multiple frameworks referenced:  
  - **SLSA**, **C2PA**, **Croissant**, **Xygeni**, and others  
- SBOM viewed as a form of attestation (Bob, Dick)  
  - [Xygeni Attestation Format Docs](https://docs.xygeni.io/xygeni-products/build-security/attestation-format)  
- Comparison of SPDX with other formats shows differing levels of detail (e.g., Croissant more detailed for data)  
- Profiles and ontologies may help support multidimensional models and ecosystem alignment  
- Descriptions and categorization of relationship types in SPDX may need to be expanded  
- **Bentley/PKO** work may support hierarchical integration  
- **Victor** raised mapping of business controls to technical details (e.g., OSCAL)  
- **Dick** highlighted need for guidance on populating supplier names  
  - [Supplier Name Guidance – LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7337945869616373760?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABMsYcB3I6zhtjaqBqVcePEOQqxsZNzj5E)  
- **Victor** suggested alignment of knowledge graphs (referenced [arXiv article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07223))  
  - Consider discussing with Slava on insights from Croissant
