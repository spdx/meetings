## Agenda

* Prioritize agenda

* Continue discussion of feedback to CISA
* Archiving stale SPDX repos
  * Archive tools repo and send visitors to tools-java, https://github.com/spdx/tools/issues/318
  * Other repos?
* 2.x maintenance – most of these PRs have one review and wait for merging
  * Fix schema bug (Snippet "name" is not required in spec, but required in schema)
    * 2.2.2 https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1020
    * 2.3 https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1273
    * 2.3.1 https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1021
  * Fix spec cardinality typo (externalDocumentRef's Required = No, but cardinality is 1..*)
    * 2.3 https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1229
    * 2.3.1 https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1230
* 2.x maintenance policy / deprecation notice of older specs
  * Need to be on https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/ page as well?
  * The CISA 2025 Minimum Elements draft document said "agencies should avoid accepting SBOMs for new software generated in ***deprecated versions*** of any format to maintain compatibility with SBOM consumption and management tools." -- Does SPDX have a process of deprecating an SPDX version? Where we publish that information?

## Notes

* Agreed to approve minutes
* Feedback to CISA
  * Briefly discussed the document that is proposed to be submitted - Art had some additional comments regarding the Appendix that he would like to see added. Rose will incorporate.
  * Should we deprecate older versions of SPDX? We haven't deprecated older versions as of now. Let's discuss more next week
* Redacted/known unknowns: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1105
  * The fact that something is redacted may also be redacted.
  * Is the non-existence of something enough?
  * If we want to put an explicit indicator for this it will probably need to be on the element.
  * This could also be done as an annotation - because this should be so rare, we could create annotation property
    * Could create annotation type known/unknown or redacted
  * If something is a known unknown we probably need a comment about how/why SBOM author came to that conclusion
  * Possible use case: When license is redacted but not the component – put known unknown/redacted on the nearest object
  * Use case: the entire document is redacted - how to handle?
  * Discussed some type of machine readable identifier in the annotation statement field to point to the known unknown or redacted element property.
* Threats and Management
  * Definitions of terms ("threats", "assets") - assuming definitions would end up in some level of glossary/definition and that approval of them needs to go through the tech team - is this the expectation?
  * There is a glossary: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/develop/docs/glossary.md and a terms and definitions https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/terms-and-definitions/
  * Proposal to update the glossary https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1075
  * Open a PR or issue to bring discussion/additions to group

## Future Meeting topics

* Continue discussion of feedback to CISA
* 3.0 OR 3.1: Introducing digital/cryptographic signatures to the model: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1065
* Version series license families
