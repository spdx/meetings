## Notes

### Profiles Ready for Merge?

* Merge **Hardware profile**.
* The diagram is not ready yet and will be added in a separate PR later.
* A pending PR for FUSA to Hardware profile ([#1073](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1073)) had to be merged first (now merged).

### License Expressions Case Insensitivity Question [Alexios]

* Updating the `spdx-license-expressions` annex based on the last joint tech/legal call.
* **Operators** (`AND`, `OR`, `WITH`) are currently case-sensitive.
* **License identifiers** are case-insensitive, but the canonical case should be kept.
* `LicenseRef-` is case-sensitive. `Addition-Ref` is also case-sensitive.
* `DocumentRef-` is not currently documented, but the proposal is to keep it consistent with `LicenseRef-` and `AdditionRef-`. There was no disagreement.
* `NONE` and `NOASSERTION` are now added to the expression syntax. The consensus is that they should be **case-insensitive**, as most tooling will likely treat them that way.
* The RDF section is out of date and will be removed.

### Update from the PackageURL Standardization [Michael Herzog]

* Plan to submit to **ECMA** on September 1, with approval expected in December.
* Introduction of **JSON Schemas**.
* Shift focus from generic PURL component rules to registered PURL Types.
* New PURL type for non-packaged software: **"scid"** (Software Component IDentification) - [purl-spec/issues/516](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/516).
* The PURL spec has been re-written in Markdown: [purl-spec/pull/586](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/586).
* **VERS** specification for version range: [vers-spec](https://github.com/package-url/vers-spec/).
