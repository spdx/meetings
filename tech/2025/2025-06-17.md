### Key Discussion Topics

#### `hasSecurityContactPoint`  
[Issue #861](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/861)  
Discussed extending the `ContactPoint` with `contactType` for categorization (e.g., security, regulatory). Proposed adding `hasContactPoint` to `relationshipTypes` vocabulary in Core Profile. Rose working on PR.

#### External Identifier Types  
Rose proposed adding `phone` and `webpage` as external identifier types. PR forthcoming.

#### Location and Event Action Data  
Steven: Time should be timestamp-based, not a validity range. `creationTime` not appropriate for asserting fact creation. Nicole supported approach. Steven to draft PR.

#### SoftwareService Description  
Discussed suggested changes to [Issue #1013](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1013).  
[PR #1030](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1030) needs a second reviewer.  
**Action Item**: Kate to queue and merge if appropriate.

#### Safety Profile Overview  
Nicole presented Functional Safety Case and new Requirement Class/Context models.  
Gary supported `verifiedUsing` semantic extension and starting a new `profile-safety` branch.  
Goal: shared requirement elements for both hardware and safety contexts.

#### Action Event Data  
Deferred. Static data from events might be better represented as annotations for now.

#### SCITT + SBOMs  
Bob and Victor to follow up offline.  
Reference: [SCITT Draft Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/)  
Discussion of SCITT vs. in-Toto vs. DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation) for different stages of the supply chain.
