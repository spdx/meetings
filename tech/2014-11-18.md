## Agenda

  - Review Draft
  - Discuss Bruno's email

## Auto-Generated

Reviewed Bruno's suggestion of adding Auto-Generated.

  - Agreed that we should avoid any designation of copyright treatment
    since this is a legal opinion
  - Suggest using relationship type Generated From. Not as specific as
    Auto-Generated, but additional specifics could be added to the
    relationship comments

## Snippet Support

Reviewed support for snippets. Since we agreed in the past to postpone
support until after 2.0 suggesting taking this up for 2.1.

## Draft Review

  - Are we going to have a picture of the model in the spec.?
  - 1.1, 1.2, and 1.0 specs do not seem to have a diagram
  - Current UML diagram is out of sync with the current spec
      - Gary will update the UML diagram on Wiki
      - Suggestion to create a tech report on the UML diagram for the
        2.0 spec
  - Will continue reviews and comments to the using Google Docs.
