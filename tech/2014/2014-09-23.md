## Review 2.0 Document

  - Discussion on externally referenced SPDX document
      - Agreed to add a subsection to section 2 to describe externally
        referenced document (including the URI and checksum), and
        describe the URI for the document itself
      - Should the URI for the document itself be required?
          - It is required for the RDF format
          - External references will need a URI
          - Since they need to be unique, having it required will help
            ensure uniqueness
          - Agree
      - How are the URI's generated Gary will follow-up with an email
        based on the previous proposal at LinuxCon - In bug 818
      - No need for external document checksum in the relationship - it
        will be in the subsection in section 2 describing external SPDX
        documents
      - Need to update RDF Model
          - Document properties for externally referenced SPDX documents
            and their checksums
          - Remove externalDocumentChecksum from the Relationship
