## Attendees

  - Bill Schineller
  - Gary O'Neall
  - Scott Sterling
  - Matt Germonprez

## Agenda

  - Review filetype proposal from Kate

## Relationship and Usage type documentation

  - All can contribute text for relationship types directly to the
    spreadsheet at:
    <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13MuhIhmdSx5e9B7OCuz_CUoYRtAu-WU08SbIMlym5Xc/edit#gid=585252373>
  - Gary volunteered to take a pass at the spreadsheet

## Filetypes

  - Can we drop cruft?
      - Use case - non licensing impacting files (e.g. git or subversion
        meta data)
      - Usage type is more appropriate for recording this information
      - Will move the conversation over to the usage type
      - Added usage type usageType\_nonlicenseImpacting
      - Usage/relationship type update
  - Suggestion to add the filetypes to the google doc of relationship
    and usage
  - How do we handle the ambiguities?
      - Should we define when to use which file type (e.g. executables
        should always use binaries and not application)

## GSoC Update

  - Merge tool - a bit behind original expected code, but should be
    seeing some info posted to the tech dist. list today
  - Automated spdx creation - Matt is working with the student, should
    see some info posted by end of day to the dist list
      - Not currently using the SPDX git repo - decided not to change
        this at this time (could be disruptive to the project). Will
        discuss at end of project.
