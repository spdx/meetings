## Agenda

  - Review instance diagrams
  - POM plugin efforts

## Instance Diagram Review

  - No updates since last meeting
  - Plans for future instance diagrams:
      - a 'distro' with a kernel + packages (e.g. Android)
      - a java e.g. Hibernate scenario
          - spdx of sources of whole github repo,
          - spdx of binary jars (finer grained artifacts) they publish
            to maven (refer back to sources spdx)
          - spdx of an application that uses jars (refers back to spdx's
            of binaries)

## Apache Maven/ POM Plugin efforts

  - Effort underway to create a Maven plugin which creates an SPDX file
    from a Maven POM file
  - Reviewed issues from Maven mailing list
  - Issue with using POM license info
      - not always filled in
      - not always accurate
  - Feedback from Maven community is it would only be valuable if the
    code was scanned
      - Discussed targeting the code originators and the value to the
        originators
  - suggestion to use the SPDX standard license short names in the POM
    file
  - Plugin currently uses the standard SPDX license URL's and there is
    some indication that Apache will use those URLs
  - where in a Maven repo would .spdx file(s) best land?
      - one per GAV?
      - one per GAVCP C=Classifier e.g. binary vs. sources.jar
        P=Packaging e.g. war or jar

        (SCANNED)

<!-- end list -->

  - Apache Maven guys: anyone have connections with them to influence
    SPDX adoption?
      - Here's a list of contributors to Maven
        <https://www.ohloh.net/p/maven2/contributors?sort=latest_commit&time_span=12+months>
      - Maven License Plugin project we might join forces with?
        <http://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/>
  - Other organizations originating or assembling code will face similar
    issues as the Maven/POM - could use this as a good test case

## Next Week

Next Week - Bill and Gary will not be on the call. Will check with Kate
to see if we should have a call next week.
