## Agenda

  - 
## Document ID proposal

  - Gary will update proposal to include the RDF and tag/value specifics

## Checksums

  - Reviewed syntax
  - Resolved discrepancy found in the 1.2 spec regarding the RDF
    checksum syntax (the file checksum example is not correct, the
    package checksum example is correct)
  - Agreed to add MD5, SHA256
  - Discussed if we should add additional checksums
      - Agreed that we will start small and add additional checksums in
        future minor releases
  - Kate will add the additional the number of bits to the description
    for MD5 and SHA256 (similar to the current SHA1 definition)
  - Agreed not to mess with the verification code - we will revisit when
    we discuss signing in a future release

## License Expression Language

  - Discussion on where to define the license list exception id's
      - will include in spec as an appendix
  - Mark will hand over the license expression document to Kate to
    include in the specification
  - NOASSERTION and NONE - currently in the license expression document,
    but should be pulled out into a section global to the SPDX document.
    Suggestion to define once in the document.
      - Appendix of definitions
          - Should be the first appendix
          - Will include some of the syntax definitions which are
            currently in the RDF section
  - will discuss next week along with the appendix refactoring

## File Tagging

  - Do we need to specify it?
  - Need to have a discussion on whether this should be specified.
  - Need to be careful that the spec is done right if we do go down that
    path.
  - Agree that we can separate this from SPDX 2.0.
  - Agree that Wiki page for the tagging should describe this as a best
    practice and subject to change
  - General agreement that this should be a separate SPDX specification
    from the SPDX document, but we may revisit this in the future.
