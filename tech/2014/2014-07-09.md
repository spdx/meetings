    information

## Review sample RDF document with external references

  - Should the URL naming convention include a ".spdx"? Since it is an
    RDF document, perhaps not.
  - Relationship type to external SPDX packages will depend on the type
    of package being described by the related package - binary it may be
    a "copyfrom" type relationship
  - The verificationCode in the relationship class could be just a value
    and not the entire thing
  - Should the verificationCode be the hashcode of the containing
    document - yes - hash of the file on disk - captured in bug 818
    which Bill will update the proposal in the bug - will discuss next
    week
  - Can we use the namespaces to shorten the RDF document - need to
    research why the resource="..." is using the full URL path
