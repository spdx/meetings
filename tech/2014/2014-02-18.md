## SPDX 2.0 requirements document

  - Previous versions have been reviewed by business team, no feedback
    has been received from the tech team
  - Business team priority of use cases need to be reconciled with tech
    team thoughts - pls. review the next draft
  - Question on the "use of meta tag"
      - Not sure what this term means
      - The term meta tags refers to the use of SPDX license IDs in
        source code
      - could probably be a better term
      - Kirsten will update requirements doc to be more descriptive
  - Plan to post this week for one more review then it should be final
  - Feedback to both take out and leave in the use case references
  - Decided to leave them out

## Google Summer of Code

  - Michael, Gary and Matt have drafted a Summer of code proposal
  - Linux Foundation already an organization
  - With the help of Mike Dolan, we got approval to add out projects to
    the Linux foundation projects proposal page
  - The projects are not yet posted
  - Background on Google summer of code:
    <https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1>
  - Project proposal at
    <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/gsoc/gsoc-2014-spdx-projects>
  - Michael will craft an update email to the groups
  - will likely need more mentors for projects

## Genivi SPDX adoption

  - Kate is working with Genivi who are looking at adopting SPDX as part
    of their compliance
  - Background on Genivi can be found at <https://www.genivi.org/>
  - starting to do generations for OE/Yocto on their code base
  - Kate will post further updates to the tech team mailing list
  - Looking at the Fossology / SPDX work from UNO as a starting point
    for a scan
  - Would be a good test case for SPDX 2.0

## Tag/Value

  - Feedback from Liang, JSON may not be as readible as tag/value
  - We're still leaning towards unifying, but based on Liang's feedback
    we should look at a tag/value format
  - Kate suggests along the lines of E\#: Tag: Value, as way of handling
    abstraction/element references
  - Gary generally thinks that sounds like it should be possible to
    translate to/from
  - Kate will post a proposal to the mail list
