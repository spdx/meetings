## Agenda

  - Review model and RDF extensions for the License Expression Language

## Draft Reviews

  - Standard License in the model - Should it be renamed to Listed
    License? Legal team has requested it to be renamed to Listed
    License.
      - Change name of Standard License to SPDX License list in Appendix
        I. Bill made a recommended change to the spec.
      - The use of ListedLicense in the model may be confusing since it
        is a subclass without a specific license
  - Discussed inheritance and model for LicenseWithException
      - Should it be a subclass of SimpleLicenseInfo or License?
          - Pro's - easier to understand, would not need the property to
            relate back to a SimpleLicenseInfo
          - Con's - Not as flexible as the proposed subclass of
            AnyLicenseInfo and inconsistent with how we treat
            ConjunctiveLicenseSet and DisjunctiveLicenseSet
          - Agreed to keep the current proposed relationship
      - The name LicenseWithException is confusing - implies it is a
        type of (or subclass of) License
          - Proposed new name WithExceptionOperator
      - The property for the license should be of type
        SimpleLicensingInfo instead of AnyLicenseInfo. Gary to update
        the model.
  - We also need to add the '+' operator to the model
      - Add OrLaterOperator as a subtype of AnyLicenseInfo
