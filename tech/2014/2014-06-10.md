## Google Summer of Code

  - Would like some additional visibility on status and projects
      - Being discussed in business team
      - Merge tool status discussed - progress being made. Will post
        weekly status to mailing list

## Filetypes

  - Nuno has a number of additional file types that he has used
  - Concern about too much detail and possible "re-inventing the wheel"
  - Discussion on Mime-type as a related standard
  - Question on how this impacts licensing
  - Agree that more detailed file types are needed for tooling, but is
    it needed in the resultant SPDX document?
  - Proposal: Take media type and subtype
      - Concern that we might want to express source since it is
        licensing related
  - Follow-up to map mime types to file types - Kate will follow-up

## License Expression Language

  - Mark Gisi has a draft shared with those on the call
  - Request to merge the detailed syntax descriptions from the current
    spec into the proposal
  - Discussion on parenthesis
      - Not included on the list of precedence, but described later
        (since parenthesis is not an operator)
      - Proposal to restrict prenthesis to AND and OR
          - Concern over increasing complexity
          - Agreed that it is not a good practice
          - Mark will consider adding to the spec
      - Jack proposed an alternative way of describing license
        expressions - will send to Mark for consideration
