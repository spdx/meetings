## Agenda

  - License Expression Language parsing - spanning multiple lines
  - File Tagging follow-up

## License Expression Language

Need a way to have license expression language span multiple 4 possible
approaches

  - Use parenthesis (like today)
  - Have continuation characters
  - Use begin/end text tags
  - Restrict to single line

Agree to use a parenthesis but only require it around the outside
expression. e.g.:

  - LGPL-2.1 is OK since it is only a single license ID
  - (LGPL-2.1 AND APACHE-2.0) is OK
  - LGPL-2.1 AND APACHE-2.0 is NOT OK (needs parenthesis as delimiters)
  - (LGPL-2.1 AND APACHE-2.0 OR APACHE 1.1) is OK (will use the operator
    precedence to determine expression)

## File Tagging in Binaries

  - Bill followed up on Binary inclusion of tags by declaring a string
    variable
      - Seemed OK, with caveats
          - Compilers may compile it out if the string is not referenced
          - Some may not want it due to the size of the binaries
  - Kate followed up with Ed W.
      - Ed suggested a standardized Macro for C and C++
      - Other considerations regarding linking
  - Agree that the suggestion is valuable, but may not be ready to be
    put in the spec. proper
  - Separate decisions on including the comments in the source that
    indicates the license
  - Agree separate document but publish it at the same time and have the
    separate document refer back to the SPDX dpecification
