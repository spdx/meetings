## Agenda

  - Discuss Tag/Value format choices for SPDX 2.0

## Tag/Value Format

  - Reviewed Turtle proposal
      - More readable the XML
      - Concerns on not being able to easily grep
      - Nesting (use of '\[ \]') causes the issues with grep
      - If we go with Turtle - should we stop supporting RDF/XML and
        just go with one format?
          - Would greatly simplify the spec and tooling
          - Possible concern with modifications to Turtle format for
            readibility
  - Reviewed JSON proposal
      - Apeals to most developers
      - May apeal to both communities (Linux and Java)
      - Does not support Schema's for validation which could be an issue
        for validation
      - People on the call were favorable to JSON as a format
  - General willingness to explore alternative formats if it helps drive
    us to a single format
  - Another possibility is to continue to use the tag/value format using
    the adjacent tag/value pairs to describe what is contained within
    the more complex objects
      - Not sure if this is doable with the SPDX 2.0 use cases (not sure
        that it is not doable either)
      - Kate will work through some of the use cases and see if this
        proposal is worth pursuing
  - Take away: This could be an opportunity to go to a singke format

## Instance Diagram

  - Bill went over the documented instance diagram for the complete
    packaged composite dlivery
  - Suggestion to use a specific example
      - Jack will provide a download URL for an example we can use and
        work with Bill
  - Use case proposal - Binary distribution
  - Use case proposal - Distro with a large package contained within it
  - Use Yocto as an example
  - Ability to express additional relationships with sufficient power to
    describe various domains (e.g. embedded systems to high level
    applications)

## Collab Summit

  - Would like to meet the day before
  - Does anyone have any office space in the bay area?
  - Kate checking with Linux Foundation to see if we can get a room for
    the day before.
