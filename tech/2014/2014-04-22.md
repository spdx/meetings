## Agenda

  - GSoC update - looks like all the students were accepted

## Relationship and Usage

  - Review of one line descriptions for added relationship/usage types
    to use case analysis
      - FileAdded, FileDeleted, FileModified - relationship is with the
        Patch File
      - FileType - should file type for patch
      - Usage type should be version
          - Patch should be patches
          - Package should be packages
  - Review of consolidated spreadsheet
      - For RDF, relationshipType\_ and usageType\_, where as tag/value
        will be treated as a keyword without the relationshipType\_ and
        usageType\_
      - Discussion on use of "By" - could be confusing with the tool
        that produces a file rather than the source file - decided to go
        with generatedFrom and generates
      - Discussion on modified, modifiedBy, and revisionOf
          - Are they all needed?
              - question on revisionOf
              - descendant and ancestor are more specific forms of
                varientOf
              - descendant and ancestor are needed for the Cisco use
                cases
              - agreed to keep all for now
      - See updated spreadsheet from the email list for results so far
