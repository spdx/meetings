## Relationship and Usage

  - Relationship type is required
  - Usage type is optional
  - Do we still need a file type
      - A usage is intrinsic to the relationship
      - A file type is intrinsic to the file - independent of how it is
        used - e.g. a binary may be optional, dynamic library, data file
        depending on how it is used
  - Review usage types from Gary's email
      - Reference\_Impl - instead of usage type Reference\_Impl - use a
        more general example?
          - Could remove
          - Reference\_Impl term has different symantics for different
            verticals
          - Agree to remove - can come back to this in 2.1
  - Review Bill's email on relationship types
      - artifactOf - should be an extended version existing property and
        not a new relationshipType
      - PatchOf - need both directions - patches or patchApplied and
        patchOn or Of
  - Review of consolidated spreadsheet
      - Gary to send out 1 line descriptions for each relationship/usage
        type in the use case analysis column
      - Next week, we can use the spreadsheet to come up with a
        consolidated list of usage and relationship types
