## License Expression Syntax

  - Dedicated appendix section
  - Current spec has disjunctive/conjunctive language sprinkled
    throughout - These will be changed to reference the new license
    expression syntax
  - Will close out bug for expressing "or later" license (bug 591)

## Relationship and Usage

  - Continuing going through the spreadsheet documenting the various
    relationship and usage proposals
  - Discussion on granularity of patches
      - Decided that fileAdded, fileDeleted, and fileModified are really
        for modifications and not patches
      - patchOf and patched are relationships are between a patch file
        and a (package or a file) - renamed and defined relationship in
        the resultant spreadsheet - see spreadsheet for conclusion
  - Agreed on copyOf to represent the "sameAs", "sourceRef", and
    "upstreamBinrary" relationship types

## 2.0 Spec draft process

  - there is a 2.0 spec doc on the wiki (.pdf and .doc version)
  - Will start adding / modifying once we finish relationship types
