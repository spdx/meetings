## Review of Kate's Draft Document

  - reviewing document located at:
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10dJ3Hjc29oAlU56OEojq4HM8jMLK6IYYGR7JJyEKubQ/edit>
  - Note - some changes were made in suggestion mode and some were made
    in edit mode. As we got into the call we decided to use suggestion
  - File Type
      - Change definition of file type to match our discussions
          - Add intrinsic to the file type - not sure how to word to
            make it readible. Added "independent on how the file is
            being used" - docs is updated
          - Agreed to remove the sentence on license impact - it is an
            interpretation which may not be accurate
      - Text file type - changed the restriction that source should be
        used since we can now have multiple file types (e.g. have both
        Text and Source file types).
      - Discussion on examples - generally agree that more examples are
        better
      - Moved README example for text down to the example section
      - SPDX definition should be more specific - an SPDX file, not just
        a file containing SPDX information
      - Tweaked wording for documentation to make it less of a
        relationship and more intrinsic to the file
      - Added application type example
  - Relationship types
      - Nameing of relationship types
          - Needs to be unique in RDF - porposal RelationshipType\_XXX -
          - Do we need to be consistent in tag/value?
              - Less readable but more consistent
              - If not unique, may make the parsing tools more difficult
          - Table the discussion on the prefixes for tag/value until we
            pull Kate back in
      - SPDXElement description - move what an element is to the
        examples
      - Comment cardinality - changed to optional one - should make it a
        best practice for adding comments if the type is other
      - Added 8.3 - related SPDX document checksum - preliminary wording
      - Agreed that it is OK to go with the blue pattern
      - Change generated from example to a source file / binary file
        relationship
