## Legal Profile

  - Communicating between tools
      - Example: How well was the match to the license – would be
        helpful for a tool to tool relationship
      - Issue – loss of information detail
      - Snippets don’t really work – will capture the line range, but
        isn’t always correct
      - Should it be simplified or include a lot of detail?
      - Thomas: I found this license in this file at this line number
      - Would like to communicate scanning results from Scancode to
        SW360
      - Would help with audits and detecting errors/bugs
      - All on the call it would be useful
      - Kate created a Google doc to track the license scanning tooling
        profile:
        <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p24qf2uNk5b1rU0m_Tvj2cD-lioFaaeJKh9PmnPbhwo/edit>
      - Kate also added a dependency tree profiles:
        <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IfcSlrDou-8KLqkLr568DKGaQiHXmt_EFsZRfcf0Ej8/edit>
      - Kate also created a Google doc for the vulnerabilities profile:
        <https://docs.google.com/document/d/11S8FTG5zSwmH-o_Conp9-mkzWyOuxC_KXx3VNHlhbws/edit>
      - Will also create an issue
  - Question on how to represent a source file: I have a question on how
    to handle declared license. If it's a short reference to a license,
    for example, how should SPDX or tool handle "See the license file"
    snippet. Should the SPDX handle it as a declared and none?
      - Thomas, Gary and Philippe think it would be declared, but the
        discussion in legal was interpreted as “None” or “LicenseRef-“
        with the text found in the file
  - Discussion on having a primary license for a package
      - Philippe will propose an extension to the license expression
      - Introduce “PLUS” operator with the same semantics as AND except
        the expression to the left of the operator is the primary
        license for the package
