## Documentation for SPDX including SEVA

  - James provided a document
  - Produced from the XML document
  - Extension to allow security classifications for each element (e.g.
    confidential)
      - Uses ISM schema
  - Discussion on approach
      - Document in sections vs get experience with proposed sections
        prior to specifying
      - Document in sections first is the traditional approach for SPDX,
        may have “culture shock” switching to a more prototyping
        approach
      - Danger in specifying first – may create implementation
        challenges and may create specs that are not widely used
  - Discussion on scope and prioritization
      - Large scope – many new sections and properties
      - Suggestion to prioritize by importance and ease of
        standardization
  - Discussion on the modeling
      - Agreed modeling will be helpful
  - Plan going forward:
      - Next week Mathew will review some of the new sections/areas
        being proposed and help prioritize which areas would be most
        useful
      - Next week’s call will focus on the use cases / prioritization
      - In 2 weeks, Gary will propose an update to the model which will
        include the higher priority areas/sections
