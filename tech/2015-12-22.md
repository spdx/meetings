## Bug List

  - Bugs were updated with any follow-up actions
  - 1329 - Will document file suffixes for tag/value and RDF/XML files
    in the 2.1 spec
  - 1327 - Case sensitivity of license ID's - will document
    clarifications in 2.1
  - 1326 - Disallow + OK - Discussion on backwards compat.
  - 1311 - Discussion on the definition of Mime types - should we just
    go with Mime type definition of application?
      - Decided to leave the spec as is and document in the best
        practices
  - Typos - Discussed having an errata to 2.0 - agreed that we don't
    need anything before 2.1 unless there is an error that could lead to
    a missinterpretation of the spec
  - 1298 - external package references - mostly there in 2.1 - Yev will
    provide a final proposal
  - 1289 - None and NoAssertion license values - Agreed this should be
    on the agenda for a joint legal call
