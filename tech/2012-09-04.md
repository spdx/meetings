## Re-cap of Linux Con discussions

  - Kate: 1.1 spec draft and rdf got in sync, releaseable
  - Fossology intent to provide Agent to produce 1.1 SPDX announced
  - Deferred modeling discussions while at Linux Con
  - Ed W. socialized idea of 'Watermarking' approach

## Discussion sparked by recent blog post

  - <http://www.murrayc.com/blog/permalink/2012/08/31/generating-spdx-files-with-licensecheck/>
  - Jack: idea for validation suite - future agenda item?
  - Kate: need to update examples - volunteer to do 'time' package
  - Kate: idea for "plug fest" at next Linux Collab summit - encourage
    those who support/produce SPDX to do so for same package and compare
    results?

## Watermarking Proposal / Demo (Ed Warnicke)

  - Source files and their compiled output are the "leaves" of
    hierarchies of copyrightable 'things', so can SPDX specify a
    watermarking approach to put licensing information directly in
    source files?
  - Reqts: Machine-readable, close to leaf, flows through hierarchy
  - Demonstrated for the C language an spdx.h defining a macro
    SPDX\_INFO. Including this header, then compiling results in an
    introspectable compiled output

## Reactions to demo

  - Peter - "ship it"? \!
  - Ed: our 'one chance' to get it right with upstream providers, don't
    rush it
  - Michael: let's decouple the spec from its 'enabling technologies"
  - Issues: concern about the SIZE compiling strings into object code
    adds to the distros.
  - Let's determine what's 'acceptable' size bloat (none\!...) and think
    about other languages too
