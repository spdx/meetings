## SPDX 1.2

  - “Final” out for review – due by Friday
  - need to update the RDF terms
  - Need to change “Unstable” to “Stable” when we change Draft to Final

## Best Practices bug 1124

  - General agreement on proposals
  - Discussion on if spec should also be clarified
  - Discussion on changing license ID’s – agreed it would be a fairly
    negative impact on current SPDX documents
  - Discussion on use of additional Boolean operators. Mark Gisi gave
    some good use cases for license notices referencing license and
    adding exceptions as well as license notices referencing current and
    future license references. Mark will write up a position paper for
    further discussion.

## Future Topics

  - SPDX 2.0 – validate the model
  - Should we move to every two weeks?
  - Will have a meeting next week and then discuss moving to every other
    week and using the mailing lists more for the discussions.
