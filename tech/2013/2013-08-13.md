## Agenda

  - 1.2 Specification review

## 1.2 Specification

  - LicenseListVersion – need to add to RDF
  - Discussion of the need to include the license matching guidelines
      - Issue: Is the license matching guidelines a best practice or
        part of the specification. Some members considered it more as a
        best practice and some members consider it an obligation. Mark
        will review the section more carfully, but for now we will leave
        it in the specification document.
      - Issue: If this is part of the spec, should it be in its own
        document? Good arguments were made for both approaches. For now,
        we will keep it as an appendix. – Kate to move section to the
        appendix
  - Other sections in Google Docs version of the spec were reviewed
  - Project home page – Gary to research if DOAP has a property for this
    already – will revisit 4.10 next week
  - Local short name – Mark will send out a proposal for discussion next
    week
  - Schedule: Should be on track to finish the specifications by next
    week (including RDF).
