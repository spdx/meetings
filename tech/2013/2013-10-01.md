## Standardizing License IDs

  - Currently, there is a Wiki describing best practices
  - Dicussion on whether it should be standardized or just a best
    practice
      - The identifier spec has not been thought through as well as
        other elements of the spec
      - There is some urgency with the Das U-Boot press release and the
        Linux Kernel tagging proposal
      - Consensus that it should be standardized, but different opinion
        on the timing
      - Next steps: Breakout discussion on standardizing license ID
        references in source code with a goal to creating a proposed
        standard or identifying specific issues to be solved in order to
        create a standard
          - Should include legal team
          - Focus on license ID references in source code, but may also
            include discussion notices and the need for capturing them
            in source as well
          - Jack will followup with Jilayne on scheduling a joint
            session, possibly the next legal call
