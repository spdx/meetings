## Agenda

  - Review of dependency proposal for 1.2 (bug 1148)

## Dependency proposal

  - Agreed to focus on file dependencies where the dependent file is
    internal to the SPDX document
  - Revised RDF proposal to reference the file URI itself rather than
    the name or the checksum
      - Gary to update proposed example in the bug
  - Review of the use case and scope for 1.2
      - Use case to find the associated source to redistribute as part
        of a binary dependency
      - Linux binary dependency example
  - Discussion on 1.2 implementation of 2.0 features
  - Question on whether the limitation on internal only limits the
    usefulness too much
      - For 1.2, comment field will be used to model the external file
      - Suggestion to use the artifactOf
  - Migration to 2.0
      - The fileDependency keyword would likely be deprecated in 2.0 –
        everyone on the call is OK with this
  - Agree to the proposal
      - Internal file references only
      - use file name rather than sha1
      - RDF should reference the file object and not use the property –
        Tentative conclusion – will be reviewed offline
