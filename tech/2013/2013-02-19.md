## Modeling

  - Reviewed proposed model
      - rename the top level SPDXFile to SPDXDoc (duplicate class name
        in the model)
      - Discussed the relationship betw SPDXPackage and SPDXFile (the
        subclass)
          - must have this; SPDX 1.1 implied containment relationship
          - Discussed examples of SPDXElementRelationship
              - 'compiledFrom' another SPDXElement....
              - 'patchTo' another SPDXElement....
              - 'isContainedIn' (SPDXPackage contains Files)
              - 'isSameAs' (exact same SHA contained in different
                packages)
          - SPDXDoc to SPDXDoc relationship ? How to uniquely refer to
            the SPDXDocument containing an SPDXElement we want to
            reference?
              - Probably need to add SPDXDocument reference in the
                relationship object
          - Discussed definition of Specifier.
              - Same as Ed’s proposal – can be a URI
              - any SPDXElement has a Specifier, which is a way that
                others can refer to 'me' ?
          - Usage: add a property to SPDXElement. Enumeration of e.g.
              - Tool, not shipped
              - Optional element (like contrib module)
              - Dynamically linked (e.g. a replaceable library like a
                jar file or DLL)

## Update from Matt and Liang
