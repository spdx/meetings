## Review of plugfest results

  - ArtifactOf best practices – documentation bug added
  - Reviewer – not sure what this issue was – request more information
    from the distribution list, if no one remembers we will drop – Kate
    to send out email
  - Download location – Best practice should point to location that is
    likely to be preserved – file level locations may go away, git
    locations are likely to be preserved – document best practice bug
  - Home page URL – enhancement to add a second URL which is the project
    home page – bug added
  - Once the home page URL is implemented, we should revisit the
    download location. The best practice may be to be specific to the
    file location even though the URL may go away. – documented in the
    download location documentation bug
  - Sorting filenames – documented best practice for SPDX Tag/Value
    format files; added bug for SPDX tools to follow the best practice
  - 4.14 in 1.1 is copyright text aggregated from all files, proposal to
    add an optional field for package level copyright if it exists
  - Field on file for notices – bug added for enhancement
  - License ref – assign name. Would need some way to make unique. Bug
    added for enhancement. General consensus that this would be a 2.0
    item.
