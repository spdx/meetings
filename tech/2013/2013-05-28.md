## 1.2 features

  - Setting target and version to 1.1 for Usage Conventions (does not
    need to be tied to a 1.2 release)
  - Usage conventions and best practices will be part of the same
    document
  - Jack will start to make entries on the Wiki for the best practices
  - Agreed the “document” should be a wiki
  - Suggestions on organization – same structure as the spec and/or have
    sections for producers and consumers
  - Bug 885 – consistency in spec – assigned to Kate – version 1.1.1
    (does not need to wait for the 1.2 release)
  - General license templating proposal will be on a separate track (not
    tied to 1.2)
  - Legal team has minutes from the recent call on the templating
    proposal
  - Bug 1000 – leave at 2.0 since it is related to code snippets
  - Bug 1075 – need to update Ruby tools, currently no owner since Peter
    left. Gary will talk to Matt to see if there is interest in UNO
    contributing.
  - Bug 1109/1127 – home page tag – target 1.2
  - Bug 1110 – tag case sensitivity – target 1.2, will revisit decision
    on if tags should be case sensitive
  - Bug 1121 – license headers – does affect the spec – optional field.
    Currently targeted to 2.0, would like to pull back to 1.2.
  - Discussion on how much we standardize the templating/headers – Gary
    will write-up the results of the templating language proposal would
    look like in the spec
  - Bug 1125 Review clarification – target 1.2

Remaining 5-6 bugs without target dates will be reviewed next week
