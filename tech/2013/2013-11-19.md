## Agenda

  - Review 2.0 model

## 2.0 model discussion

  - Reviewed current merged model proposal:
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/Proposals/2012-02-01/Merged_Model_Proposal>
      - Annotations use of comments – is it the same as the comment in
        SPDX element?
          - Does it duplicate the function, should we remove?
          - Should choose a different name in the properties/models
      - Snippets – question on the utility.
          - Agree to include in model
          - Agree that the implementation decision can be made
            separately (e.g. we don’t need to implement in version 2.0,
            could be later). General agreement that the snippet use
            cases were lower priority than the hierarchical use cases
          - Use cases for snippets were discussed – audit findings of
            GPL code snippet
          - may be important to Samsung’s use
              - Kate will go over the mode with Samsung in Japan

<!-- end list -->

  - Review email from Bruno and suggestions for 2.0
      - Allow other checksums – Add bug to track, supported by the 1.2
        and 2.0 models
      - File type – markup file type for pom.xml, Add bug to track,
        supported by the 1.2 and 2.0 models
      - Lines of code – suggest comments be added
      - Filesize
      - Discussion on how many properties we should add – don’t want to
        burden producers, extensions like annotations and comments could
        be used
  - Suggestion to use Web Protégé as a collaboration tool for the SPDX
    ontology: <http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/WebProtege>

## Next Steps for 2.0 model

  - Create instance diagrams for specific use cases – Bill is working on
    one for our next meeting
  - Translate the merged model proposal into a diagram similar to the
    1.2 model – Kate is working on this
  - Create a spreadsheet mapping between SPDX 1.2 and SPDX 2.0
    properties and keywords
  - Solve some of the mechanics of producing an SPDX RDF document (e.g.
    how do we refer to an external SPDX element)
  - Solve some of the mechanics of producing an SPDX tag/value document
    (e.g. how do we refer to other SPDX elements)
