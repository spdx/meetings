## Modeling

  - Gary will update the model based on last week’s discussion and post
    a new graphic and the input data for the model
  - Bill to send out Snippets modeling discussion out to the group for a
    broader discussion
  - Annotation Discussion
      - Annotations in Ed’s proposal are used for properties (both
        standard and additional properties) and for a “changelog”
      - Merged model is using it more as a changelog
      - Should the Annotations be tied to the relationship?
      - It could also be tied to the SPDXDocument or the SPDX Element
      - Are comments sufficient?
          - Annotations are more machine readable
      - Proposal to handle changelogs with comments in the Relationship
        object
      - Proposal to handle changelogs with Reviewer comments
      - Agreed to move the discussion from Annotations concept in
        general to more specific use cases
      - One use case that needs exploring is the “changlogs” for new
        versions of SPDX documents
      - Tabling annotations and keeping SPDX elements alive
      - Should we have the SPDX relationship at the SPDX Doc level, SPDX
        Element level, or both?
      - Agree to remove annotation from the model for now
      - Agree to add a SPDX Doc to SPDX doc relationship
      - ArtifactOf – need to discuss how this relates to the
        relationship (follow-up discussion)
      - Add comment to relationship objects
