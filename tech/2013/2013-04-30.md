## Review proposal for license matching from Daniel

  - Agree that regex is OK approach
  - Concern on possible errors in regex's
      - Publish guidelines on the acceptable regular expressions for
        certain rules
  - Discussion naming convention
      - Agree that some convention is needed
      - Request guidance for legal
      - Should we require the names to be unique within a license? \[no
        conclusion\]
  - Should the type (required or optional) handled by regular
    expressions? \[no conclusion\]
      - Could be handled by regex (e.g. 0:1)
      - Would require more knowledge of regular expressions to use
  - Agree that keywords are lowercase
  - Come up with some new names for the keywords (needs to be more
    specific)
  - When are the regular expressions being applied, before or after
    being normalized?
      - After normalization has the advantage of simpler regular
        expressions
      - Normalization would require more specification to the rules
        (e.g. which equivalent word to we normalize too)
      - Normalization prior to processing the regular expressions would
        reduce some of the matching capabilities. For example, if you
        really wanted to match exactly the word "Copyright",
        normalization would allow other equivalent terms to be matched
      - Agree to discuss this at a later date
