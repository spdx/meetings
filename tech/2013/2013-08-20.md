## Agenda

  - 1.2 Specification review

## 1.2 Specification

  - Bug 1132 – license ID’s
      - Do they need to be unique across documents – Agreed that this
        would be useful
      - Goal for readability and a separate goal for separate license
      - Agree to solve the readability for 1.2 and keep the namespace
        issue open for later
      - Agreed on a proposal to allow licenseRef-N to be optionally
        replaced by licenseRef-\[string that follows the same rules as
        the SPDX standard license ID\]
      - Gary to review the SPDX standard license ID rules
  - Changed package home page property to DOAP hompapge property
  - Will discuss Mark's proposal on dependencies next week
