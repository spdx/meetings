## Agenda

  - Modeling
  - Bugs that may be limiting adoption

## Bugs

  - Kate reported on a potential problem coming in through email – Kate
    to document as a bug for future discussion
  - Review of other bugs on the bugs page (note – bugs were updated with
    comments)
      - JSON support on license HTML pages (bug 1087) – general support
        for adding this as long as it does create any additional
        maintenance effort
      - Comment processing still broken for tag/value SPDX tools – Gary
        will follow-up and see if anyone at Protecode is available to
        help
      - Making verification code optional – will be discussed in the 2.0
        discussions
      - Bug 1000 – copyright relationship to conjunctive licenses – this
        could be an interesting bug to consider when modeling. This bug
        may be solved with the introduction of snippets into the model
        (a file optionally contains snippets of code). We will pick up
        the conversation in 2.0
      - Signed SPDX datasets – part of the 2.0 use cases
