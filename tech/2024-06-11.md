## Notes

### Translations
- Propose change to branch structure for the spec repo
  - 1 branch per release
  - The release branches would be updated as new translations occur
  - Only translations are allowed to be added to the release branch - no changes to the existing languages
  - Question on tags - would we hae a release tag?
    - Yes - we would need to add tags when languages are available
- After the initial release of English + any other available languages, the translations would not be automatically moved to the new development branches, tranlators would review the changes and add all files when they are ready - not incremental.  We would start with empty translations when we start a new development branch
- Could use diffs between tags to get what has changed from a previous release
- Translators can decide on the best automation
- Decision: change branch structure as proposed
- Use Main for the in development - 
- TODO: Need to change the CI - branches are hard-coded
- Directory structure
  - separate directories for languages
  - need to document that "en" is the normative language
    - two places for doc updates: the automated tools config and the human-readable docs
- Model Repo
  - Will only translate the summary and description "snippets"
  - It will something like: 
en/Classes/Agent.md:

# Agent

## Description

  - Single file or separate files being discussed
  - If we choose the one file per one language approach (and group all the files in the same lang into one directory)
  - Another concern we discussed during the translation meeting is the amount of PR in different languages that a lot of us cannot understand
  - Single file is easier for the tooling but increase the risk that we would break the build
  - Any translation PR should only include translations
    - We can check that no normative language was changed
    - Can use Git history to identify where re-translations are required
      - Could also be done late in the release cycle
- Add a label for translations we can use to filter PR's and issue - could to per language, but a minimum would be to have a translation label
- In terms of release cycle, in L10n software process there’s a stage we call “string freeze” that means other part of the code can change but not the string. This is to allow the translators to work. — May be we have to think about when to announce this “string freeze” in our 3.x process.

### PR's and Issue Discussion

- Fix all JSON-LD examples - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/762 - Merged
- Relationships: Note class contraints on security types -   https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/764 - Merged
- Version selector dropdown: Removing RC versions of the versions with stable release?  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/952 - Agreed, Arthit will create a PR
- Add build instruction and flow diagram -  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/971 - Merged - concern about whether this should be in the top level README, suggest separate issue / PR after merging
- github actions: Fix workflow - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/86 - Merged, Arthit will ammend a PR which corrects some inconsistencies in the directory structure
 
### Examples
- Questions at  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/85#issuecomment-2158451000
- Will be discussed in this week's implementer's call (ran out of time)
- Arthit suggested: spdx3ToGraph tool is really helping me when I try writing the examples
