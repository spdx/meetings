## Other Initiatives Discussion

  - Nisha attended Kubecon and remarked on seeing lots of interest in
    SBOM's in the container space, but folks not sure where to engage.
  - Multiple efforts underway, OCI, CNCF/InToto, CDF Security Sig/OMG
    SBOM working group, NTIA - each has own perspective

## 3.0 Model

  - Proposed update from William
  - Came out of feedback from OMG workgroup, which looked at approach
    from Framing group from NTIA (see www.ntia.gov/SBOM)
  - Feedback on current model:
      - Exclusively focused on licensing and IP
      - Not very approachable
  - Different profiles for the different usages (e.g. IP, Security)
  - Feedback: Change “Intellection Property” to “Licensing” for profile
    name
  - Tooling – do we need to support all profiles?
      - SPDX focused on syntax
      - Producers and consumers have policies on what profiles are
        supported
  - Discussion on Relationship – issue has already been added
  - Discussion on FilesAnalyzed – William will add an issue to track

## SPDX Document License

  - We didn’t have a quorum to discuss completely
  - Steve and Jilyane are researching the reasons for the mandatory
    DataLicense: CC0-1.0 declaration currently in use
  - Request that those who would like it changed to document the reasons
  - Philippe suggested that for some use cases where there is a contract
    in place between the supplier and consumer, the license for the SPDX
    document be in the license and not the document itself
  - Steve will open an issue to track

## Joint Legal/Tech calls

  - Settle on start of new year, Steve to put out a calendar invite.
