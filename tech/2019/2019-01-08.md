## Documentation for SPDX including SEVA

  - Agreed to create a proposal or draft for the SEVA vulnerability
  - Create a separate repo for the XML – e.g. github.com/spdx/spec-xml
  - For now, we will just add a section to the 2.2 spec and clearly
    define that it is a draft
  - Separate out only vulnerability information into its own repo
  - Plan:
      - Separate out vulnerability information into its own document for
        review by NIST – section 7
          - will work off a Google doc. Copy section 7 from:
            <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KcKPfR0_14KL_qC20U1o7Hrdxz2dHOKWDIB2gsFPvgk/edit#>
      - Have NIST review the fields and comment
      - Create a github issue – Kate will add
      - After feedback, move to a proposal section

## Next Week

    github repo
