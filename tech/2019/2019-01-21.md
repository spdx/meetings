## GSoC

Discussed this year’s Google Summer of Code for SPDX.

  - Mentors
      - Rohit, Steve, Gary, Philippe, Jack, Kate have all signed up as
        mentors
      - There is another student interested in mentoring, but we
        probably have enough mentors based on the number of projects
  - Project ideas – wiki page is a little light:
    <https://wiki.spdx.org/view/GSOC/GSOC_ProjectIdeas>
  - Rishi Bhatnagar emailed a proposal to write a new GoLang RDF Parser
    as an SPDX project
      - probably don’t want to do much more with RDF – looking more at
        2.2 updates which Steve will add as a project idea
          - Once the Golang project proposal is on the wiki, we’ll
            follow-up with Rishi and direct him to other project ideals
  - Several new ideas were raised on the call
      - Golang tools – update to 2.2
      - Plugin for NPM – Kate will work on project idea, will sync up
        with Gary on Friday
      - Gary to put back the Develop a Distributed License Repository
        Management Application
          - this may be too much overlap with last year’s project
            <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools/wiki/Registry-and-repository-of-License-List-Namespaces:-GSOC-2019>
      - Gary to start the org submission but not submit until the
        project ideas have been updated
  - Project ideas will be discussed at FOSSDEM Friday meeting and the
    Wiki page will be updated at that time
  - Project

## 2.2 Release

  - Will pick up discussions next Tuesday
