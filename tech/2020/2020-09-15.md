## Demo of new online tools

  - A test version of the online tools is available at
    <http://52.32.53.255/>
  - Walked through the functionality
  - Discussion on the namespace features
      - Organizations – can only be added by authorized users
          - We could use this to help maintain who has the ability to
            add which organizations to license namespace
      - Request Mark Atwoord (Amazon), Philippe (NexB), and FOSSology to
        review the new namespace functionality

## Schema Generation

  - Overview of current process
      - RDF OWL document is the base format used to generate all other
        documents
      - OWL document is kept manually in sync with spec with the spec
        being the source of record
  - Desire to change process in the future
      - Automatically keep document and OWL documents in sync
      - Have a different mechanism for describing the constraints that
        is more convenient than OWL
          - OMG is using OWL and SHACL
          - SHAX is another possibility
          - David is working on a graph language that may help – will
            keep us up to date

## Facts vs Opinions in SPDX Documents

  - Currently, principle stated that documents are focused on facts
  - Some of the proposals for new profile introduce things that are not
    necessary facts
      - Proposal to extend Relationship to include things that may not
        be facts
      - Proposal to add Annotations to capture assertions about
        information in the document.
  - Example – expiration information, but from the SPDX ASIA call, there
    is also product usage (ok for testing), as well as affiliation of
    components with specific products.
