        used
          - This was the original intent of concluded license
      - Thomas expressed an interest in clearly declaring a
        non-disjunctive license at the point of distribution
          - Different distributed licenses may be chosen for different
            customers
      - Documentation currently doesn’t capture the disjunctive choice
        scenario for concluded license
      - Concluded is currently used for both adding a reviewed
        conclusion on the license data and for the choice of disjunctive
        licenses
      - Vicky recommended that since the tool creators are requesting
        it, that should weigh in to the decision.
      - Brad suggested teasing apart the document creator and the
        artifact creator when defining distributed license
          - Kate agrees that clarity around roles is going to be needed
  - General support for moving to 2 fields for every artifact
    DeclaredLicense and ConcludedLicense
