Topics:

  - Base Profile

## Base Profile

  - Other profiles (legal and vulnerabilities/defects) are currently
    blocked on documentation structure
  - Need a basic structure to start from
  - Need to core basically be defined
  - How aligned is the spec with 3T?
  - Don’t want to wait for the entire base to be specified
  - We have a diagram for Base that is pretty close
  - Should we have a diagram for the other profiles?
  - Licensing isn’t currently blocked – using a Google doc with text to
    make progress
      - Format looks similar to the 2.2 spec text
      - Would like to move to Github which will require a format to be
        specified
  - Need to follow the ISO profile as far as format
  - How do we specify which profiles are in effect
      - Clause 6 – Document information
  - Should we use the 2.2 format?
  - Document structure is in Google Docs at
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pAxCjXER5c_tdAjIIqK2Ipz5AvirH81GQuG5CsP8wk/edit>
  - Discussion on Artifact superclass
      - Package, File and Snippet are concrete classes based on Artifact
      - Artifact is abstract
  - Should we check into 3.0 branch?
      - Current 3.0 branch was done before Rex’s reformatting
      - Rename 3.0 branch and create a new branch based on 2.2.1
      - DCO BOT is enabled for the spec repo in the branch protection
        rules
      - William will create a new branch
  - Steve will start putting the license in the new branch once
    available
  - If anyone has an issue blocking their profile, they will add an
    issue
  - Nisha asked if the base profile fields are locked down or if they
    are open to changes
      - Not locked down – can add
      - Base will be rather minimal
      - Profiles should work out what they need and raise issues when
        they need something to base
  - Are we adding fields to relationships?
  - Are annotations going to be used for defects?
  - Need to describe problem statements as well as solutions
  - Create a label “Blocked” if a team is blocked in making progress
  - Create a label for each profile
  - Create a meta-issue for each profile – optional
  - Subteams would decide if they need a diagram – if so, extend the
    base diagram
  - When the spec is complete, each profile will have its own diagram
    based on the base profile
      - Uses draw.io (a.k.a. diagrams.net)
      - Draw.io file can be saved

## Next Week

  - Thursday is a joint tech team legal call
  - Tuesday may be a continuation of Thursday’s call
  - How interoperate between profile teams – if times allow
      - Diagrams
          - Python class diagrams
          - diagrams.net format
          - Plant UML
