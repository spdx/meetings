## 2.2 Release

  - Thomas described meeting at FOSDEM OpenChain Reference Tooling Group
    – SPDX presentation; described perceptions of bad and good items in
    SPDX
  - Demonstrated new use of GitHub Actions + publisher to generate 2.2 /
    3.0 spec draft versions
  - Discussed PR \#196 for new appendix for file tags. Steve will update
    PR to better clarify relationship to existing short-form license
    identifiers format, otherwise attendees were in favor of adding.
  - Discussed PR \#197 with new formats examples – plurals vs. singulars
    for e.g. annotation, package, etc.
      - Proposed: In new XML format, any new property where cardinality
        is \>1, will have two properties: singular to represent the
        individual element, and plural to represent the array of
        elements. E.g., <annotations> wrapping around individual
        <annotation> entries
          - JSON / YAML will then use the plural form for the array name
  - Discussed new issue \#192 for OPTIONAL\_DEPENDENCY\_OF relationship
    -- attendees were generally in favor but didn't feel there was
    quorum to give a full approval, would welcome others commenting /
    reviewing that issue.
