## Minutes

Future call: will discuss examples / model for SPDX for container images

### Update on license model

High-level changes:
* moved model into draw.io
* draft working document is in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_9jkthfa5Pjpqb62gV-8WGplANQ7MD-V9Y64KOTFZ3c/edit
* changes discussed last week including:
  * custom license exceptions
  * added noassertion and none licenses
  * cleanup of operators
  * added custom license under license

* open questions:
  * SimpleLicensingInfo and License are still two separate classes
    * Steve: suggest merging these and then merging ExtractedLicenseInfo and CustomLicense into the same
    * Gary: will do that for the next, will also do conforming rename to exceptions class
  * diagram doesn't show cardinality; maintain in

* Exceptions:
  * Rishabh: what about e.g. something using OR-LATER and also having an exception?
  * Steve: also, some licenses in practice may have two different exceptions
  * Gary: capturing these as issues
    * will make it so that WITH can be applied to AnyLicenseInfo

* Discussed https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/346 -- extending '+' to cover exceptions?
  * discussed on call, expect that it would be challenging and not a significant use case

* Discussed https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/123 -- semicolon operator ';'
  * Steve and Gary agreed, not helpful for current model

* Discussed keeping serialized formats in "preferred" data type for that format
  * e.g. license expression should be string in tag-value but license tree object in RDF
  * agreed, don't force everything into model object format

### Update on base profile model

* Document available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pAxCjXER5c_tdAjIIqK2Ipz5AvirH81GQuG5CsP8wk/edit
* Updated to the model since our last discussion - labeled 2020-current in the document
* Changes to identity
  * email is now common to all identitied (including tools)
  * tool has a [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)
* Artifact changes
  * ArtifactUrl now a first class property
    * ArtifactUrl is a superclass of [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)
    * Allows for use in things like hardware or a service
    * Optional property
    * ArtifactUrl would have a unique prefix similar to PURL (e.g. svc: for service, hw: for hardware)
    * Discussion on if we still need externalReferences once we ArtifactUrl
    * We could move homePage to externalReference
    * Still valuable to have externalReference for software heritage
    * We could combine the externalReference locator with ArtifactURL
    * Human readable information would find homepage valueable as a direct property of the artifact or package
    * Agreement there is overlap between ExternalReference and ArtifactUrl
    * Current cardinality is optional 1
    * If we combine ExternalReference, we would need multiple - and then we may want to have a "primary" ArtifactUrl
    * In the 3TSBOM meetings, there was a strong desire to make the cardinality 1 mandatory
    * ExternalReference is "additional" reference information rather than the identity

Next Week
* Continue discussion on combining ArtifactUrl and ExternalReference
* Discuss last remaining difference - Relationships being a subclass of Artifact
