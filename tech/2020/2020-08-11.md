## Legal Profile

  - Initial draft by Steve and Jilayne in Google Docs
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_2tSlFXvW_SbW-I1DcSEoCNBMQJd4FEFIQr6KCJuyU/edit#>
  - Note: didn't really update section numbers
  - Note: Has not been reviewed by the entire legal team – will review
    in upcoming legal team meeting
  - Normalized naming (e.g. references to Spdx Document rather than Spdx
    File) - this needs to be done across spec
  - Focus on artifact fields - consolidation of license related fields
    for Package, Files, and Snippets. Not much to change for
    Document-License List Version field or filed in Other Licensing Info
    section.
  - Discussion on Declared License for Package – metadata
      - Thomas raised question on if the Artifact includes the metadata
        or if it is different
      - Discussion on the previous discussions
          - Maven POM files was discussed previously and general
            agreement that the POM license info would be declared but
            not concluded
          - POM file license information was not always accurate
      - Different scenarios discussed, general agreement that a binary
        distribution would be a different artifact from the bundle of
        source
  - Discussion on license information that is not completely in the file
    (e.g. jQuery which includes a link but not the license notice)
      - Some tools will fill in the actual license referred to
  - Should we document the examples for Declared and Concluded licenses?
      - Valuable information
      - More specific would be better, but would make it larger
          - Would be nice to have some additional documentation
            somewhere
      - Generally agree to move from the specific fields to the intro
        for the section
  - Discussion on None field for license
      - Should the field be renamed NONE\_FOUND?
          - Concern it would break tools
      - General agreement that NONE means someone looked really hard for
        a license and couldn’t find one at all
      - In the case of “No Rights Reserved”, one would create a
        LicenseRef-
  - Discussion cookbook
      - Could create hover over in the spec
          - Concern about accessibility
  - Replacing references to Disjunctive license with “OR”
  - Continue discussion on the Legal team this Thursday
  - What is the name of the profile for licensing?
      - “Licensing”
  - Discussion on associating copyright owner with license
      - Thomas has a requirement to associate the license with the
        copyright owners
      - Current SPDX does not have a mechanism to retain the
        associations
      - Could use snippets to retain the association between copyright
        owners and licenses for specific code
