## 3.0 Model OMG Proposal

  - Reviewed Will’s model proposal from Japan
  - Discussed the analysis of the OMG model proposal
  - Discussed the proposed changes to SPDX
      - Does not capture the simplification of the model that Will
        proposed. The intent of the analysis was to identify
        incompatibilities between the OMG model and SPDX 2.1
      - Thomas and Philippe expressed concern about adding required type
        attribute and other required changes that can be just derived
        from other parts of the document
          - Adds complexity and additional fields that are not required
      - Other changes were intended to be consistent with Will’s
        proposal and will be discussed as we continue development of the
        3.0 model

## Next Week

  - Start with proposal from Thomas and Will on a new relationship (spec
    issue 168 <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/168>)
  - Additional 2.2 topics
