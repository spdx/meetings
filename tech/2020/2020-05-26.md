## SPDX 2.2

## SPDX 2.2.1

  - Update from Rex
      - Steady progress
      - a few issues still open
      - John updating template so that there is no requirement for
        formatting
  - Discussion on proposal to add footnotes for XML
      - Agreed to remove the tables for the examples rather than go to
        footnotes
      - Still an issue with conciseness of the examples
      - Agree to keep the metadata as tables

## GSoC

## SPDX 3.0 Security Profile

  - Thomas provided an overview of the proposal:
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GyUMEcv4G8ZUGbXB8T_-pkDFxYUAbP0W0Tuts2cpZiw/edit#heading=h.szfwkkflaxx2>
  - Proposal to focus scope on Vulnerability information
      - Create separate proposals for Virus information and other areas
        of security
      - William and Gary agreed with proposal, no objections
  - Do we need a data provider identity?
      - Tradeoff of complexity vs additional data
      - having a data provider may be useful for other profiles
      - useful at the vulnerability level
      - potentially useful at the document level
      - need an identity object
      - can be a field for vulnerability
      - can also be used as in a relationship
  - Do we want to include a remediation field?
      - Proposal to include a “first patched version” field
      - Proposal to use the description field to capture the remediation
        suggestion
      - Steve suggested we stick to the facts – similar to legal profile
      - Consensus to not include a remediation field (other than the
        first patched version field which will be included)
  - Discussion on filtering
  - Do we want to include any formatting for the description (e.g.
    HTML)?
  - Identifier Aliasing
      - Agreed to use ExternalRef approach under the security category
  - What do we do with packages that don’t maintain standard version
      - The fields that refer to version is a string – added many
        possible format
  - Aligning with CycloneDX
      - Agreed that we want to have common terms etc.
      - Briefly reviewed differences
          - ExternalRef is on area of difference
          - Description vs. summary is another area
              - Suggestion to change SPDX to use description for the
                summary and details

## Next Week’s Agenda

  - How do we specify the profiles in use for 3.0
  - Legal update – suggest this would be a joint legal/tech call
