## 2.2 Release

  - Issue \#173: TEST\_OF relatiohip type – reviewed wording - merged in
    the changes and closed the issue
  - Issue \#155: Simplified tag/value syntax for enumerations - merged
    in the changes and closed the issue
  - Issue \#188: How to include package, file and snippet information
    into JSON/YAML
      - YAML and JSON typically uses an array approach while XML
        typically uses a type approach
      - Agreed to use the arrays approach for YAML and JSON
  - Issue \#189: How compact should the JSON/YAML versions of the SPDX
    document be?
      - Agreed machine readability for these formats was an important
        consideration
      - Steve raised the issue that any duplicate definitions of an SPDX
        item may lead to inconsistencies in the document
      - Compact version seems less prone to error and in some cases more
        efficient
      - Agreed to go with the compact version
      - Discussed allowing multiple options, but agreed that this would
        introduce more property names/complexity
  - Discussed the package hasFile property – should it be replaced by a
    contains relationship
      - Consensus that using the relationships would be more consistent
      - Discussed whether changing from hasFile would be a breaking
        change
          - Possible to convert from hasFile to relationship, but
            converting back may not result in the same tag/value
            document
      - Agreed to keep the hasFile property in JSON and YAML for 2.2 and
        propose changing to relationships in 3.0
