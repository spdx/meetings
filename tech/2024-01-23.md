## Agenda

* Overview of shacl2code
* Spec parser / spec website generator update
* Remaining PR's for RC2 and plans
* Concrete classes for license individuals

## Notes

### shacl2code
* Code generate
* Generates code that validates against the model using the SHACL file
* Use JINJA (sp) templates - can be extended for other languages
* https://github.com/JPEWdev/shacl2code
* Template for Python at https://github.com/JPEWdev/shacl2code/blob/main/shacl2code/templates/python.j2
* Related PR: Run shacl2code in CI https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/605

### Spec parser / website generator
* Decision made to generate the website and markdown in the spdx-spec repo
* Generation for the website itself will be generated in the spdx-spec repo
* Will need triggers to generate the spdx spec web pages
* Problem with the current action in spdx-spec
* Proposal to generate a new action for the SPDX 3 spec
  * Downside - the SPDX 3 won't be in the dropdown
* Jeff hopes to have something soon
* The HTML will go into a separate subdirectory for the spec - we can publish the URL to the subdirectory
* We'll want to make the URL prominent
* Future: we'll integrate into the dropdown
  * We'll need to resolve some of the issues with the current workflow

### spec-parser publishing
* Pull request to add packaging: https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/89
* Alexios: internal to the group - only used in the SPDX model - perhaps we should not publish publicly
* Jeff: Having a standard python infrastructure in place helps developers - friendlier and easier
* Question: how much effort to we want to spend supporting it
* Max: no option to move away from spec-parser, should be maintained
* Sean: Prefer to just work on RDF SHACL directly, but we made a decision to work on the markdown files, so feel we need the spec-parser
* Gary: Kate expressed an opinion we should just work directly on the markdown
* Gary: Opinion that we need the spec-parser - in SPDX 2.X development, it was very problematic to manually translate the documentation to schema
* Jeff: spec-parser provides very needed guardrails
* We need to decide - 
* Adolfo - Soon expecting another RC - things should be mostly frozen, should be safe to start generating tooling.  A lot of things changed after RC1.  RC should be more of a promise we can start investing.
* Decision: Merge Alexio's PR
* Max will work on new actions for the model repo tomorrow
* Hold off on the new packaging PR for now - wait for the new actions work to complete before decide

### FOSDEM face-to-face
* We'll have a face to face meeting Friday afternoon - right after Philippe's fringe event - around 5:00
* If you're coming to FOSDEM before Friday afternoon, let Alexios know if your interested
* Main topic - automated processing of model data (code generation)

### Expectations on RC2
* Should have some guarentees on stability
* OpenSSF groups are interested in trying SPDX 3 features
* Should expect change, but not big changes
* Early tooling for go - currently viewed as risky
* Need to set expectations
  * Model should be solid
  * JSON-LD serialization should be solid
  * Other serialization formats are not decided
  * Some RDF specific changes that may occur, but we do not expect it to have major impact on tooling
  * Solid but not frozen - will make changes if feedback from RC2 reviewers/implements point out problems
  * Action: when we publish RC2 - include the above expectations

### Open PRs
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/604 - Merged
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/587 - Merged
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/588 - PR updated - use "IndividualLicensingInfo" instead of "IndividualLicense" (since NoAssertion and None are not actually a license)

### Package Verification Code
* Jeff S. will reach out to Kate.  If needed will schedule a follow-up meeting

## Action Items
* Max and Alexios to work on GitHub Action related to spec-parser in spdx-3-model
* Jeff S. to coordinate next steps on Package Verification Code
* Sean will document model inheritance for SPDX 3.0
