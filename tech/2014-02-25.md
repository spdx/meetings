## SPDX 2.0 next steps and discussion

  - Next week, focus on the instance diagrams. Kate may not be able to
    join due to travel.
  - Two weeks from today, discuss the tag/value format for SPDX 2.0
  - 2.0 Draft should be up on the web, but is not advanced enough to
    publish broadly - target after collab
  - Reviewer and License sections should be largely unchanged
  - Discussion on whether we can simplify that 2 files are identical if
    they have the same sha1 and filename
      - filename may be relevant for some use cases
      - for most use cases, the sha1 is the important item as it
        identifies the content of the file
      - should document better the reasons for keeping the filename
      - will keep the files associated with the package for now and not
        try to optimize by referencing the same file object
  - Reviewer - feedback on email that some enhacements would be nice for
    2.0
      - a bug should be added to track
