      - tag/value needs to be added
      - does RDF/XML, JSON and YAML need to be added?
  - Rose will follow-up
  - Tracked in issue \#66

## License Namespace

  - Review of proposal – PR \#209
  - Some automation was done for last year’s GSoC
  - Discussion of the validation of namespaces
      - Verify the domain names before accepting
      - Could be burdensome if fully verified (e.g. modify DNS records
        to validate)
      - Propose to have a git repo for the namespaces with committers
        who can review/accept
  - Do we register all namespaces?
      - Would help manage the namespace collisions and verifications
  - Discussion on where the licenses definitions are stored and managed
      - Intent for the submitter of the namespace to manage the licenses
  - Discussion on private namespaces
      - Requested previously by Mark
      - Suggest that this would be outside the scope of proposal – you
        can use whatever text after the LicenseRef-
  - Discussion on whether this would allow for redefinition of an
    existing SPDX license
      - This is distinct from the curated SPDX license list
      - There is no implied trust between the SPDX org and the licenses
        in the namespace licenses, the trust would be between the
        creator of the SPDX document and the maintainer of the license
        namespaces
  - Need to update the rules for LicenseRef- format to disallow the
    namespace characters
  - Discussion on use of “.” For the format
      - If all namespaces are registered, you could search for the
        namespace if the text is not included in the document itself
      - Would still need some way of parsing the license ref to separate
        the namespace from the identifier
      - “-.” is prone to miss-typing
      - “-.” was chosen for compatibility – they are allowed characters
        in LicenseRef-
  - Need to define hierarchy if text is in the SPDX document and in an
    external license ref

## Incorporating attribution tags

  - Desire to summarize the attribution text to be included in the
    documentation
  - Discussion on how the field is used
      - Agree that the spec shouldn’t specify how the attribution should
        be used – open to interpretation of the license
      - Agreed on wording, PR will be updated
