## License Namespace Proposals

  - We discussed the license namespace proposal Mark Atwood circulated
    on the email distribution list
  - Since Mark was not on the call, we agreed to not finalize any
    proposal until we’ve had a larger review including Mark and the
    larger community
  - Those on the call reached consensus on the following items:
      - We should separate the issues of referencing the license text /
        metadata from the issue of license list namespaced
      - Solving the license list namespace was important
  - We discussed 3 different solutions to the namespace issue
      - Mark’s proposal of using the DNS names
      - Ad-hoc naming where any organization (e.g.
        LicenseRef-<namespace>-id) where any organization can use any
        namespace
      - A registry of namespaces which contains additional metadata
  - We discussed a few potential issues with some of the approaches
      - Uniqueness of the naming – We would like to make sure there are
        no name collisions
      - Reability of the license ID’s – We would like the ID’s to be
        easily human readable and writeable
      - Verifiable / secure – If we have an SPDX document references a
        license in a different namespace, we would like a mechanism to
        make sure the license hasn’t been changed
      - Versioning – If the license list in a specific namespace changes
        (e.g. a license is removed or modified), we would like to be
        able to refer to the version used when creating the SPDX
        document
  - We tended to favor a registration approach
      - Pro’s – can help solve the readability, uniqueness, versioning
        and security
      - Con’s – would be slower than just using a well formed license ID
        since the registry would have to accept any contributions before
        it could be used
      - Proposal to use Github as the repository for the namespace
        implementation
      - Proposal to store the license information as an SPDX document
        containing the license ID’s themselves
          - Alternative discussed was the Github repo would only contain
            a reference to an external document. This approach had
            issues with security and versioning.
      - Directory structure could contain version information
      - License ref syntax would allow mapping to a specific document
      - Versioning would be optional
      - Additions and updates to the namespaces would be pull requests
          - We could automate the verification and possibly the
            acceptance of the PR’s using a build script
      - Kate will propose more specifics
