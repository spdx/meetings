## Agenda

  - LinuxCon in August - room for Tech Team
  - SPDX 2.0 Use Cases

Kate outlined expectation that by LinuxCon in August, SPDX 1.1 should be
out, the Use Cases all vetted, and we'd be ready to start data modeling
for 2.0.

Jack suggested that we reserve a room for Tech Team at LinuxCon in
August, for the Tuesday afternoon. (i.e. suggest make flight
arrangements to arrive by Tuesday afternoon...)

We spent remainder of the concall going over/editing SPDX 2.0 Use Cases.
OK'd 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and started discussing 7.1 (SPDX Lite).
Pick up again at 7.1 next time (with Peter in attendence). Plan to
(OK-caveat) 7.1 to reflect that use case may be understood, but not yet
agreed upon for implementation.
