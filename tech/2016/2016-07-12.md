## Attendees

  - Gary O'Neall
  - Bill Schineller
  - Yev Bronshteyn

## Spec Related Implementation Issues

  - Gary ran into some minor implementation difficulties having the same
    RDF property name in the RDF for the snippet byte range and line
    range.
      - Agreed that we should leave the same RDF property name for both
        line and byte offset pointer types
      - Agreed that the property name for RDF should be "range" since it
        covers both line and byte types
      - Gary will update the RDF spec, spec and tools to reflect the
        change
  - Gary had some challenges translating the non-listed location
    external reference types between RDF and tag value
      - The spec examples did specify how this is done in tag/value
      - The approach is to use the document namespace appended by the id
        used in tag/value for the RDF URI
      - Yev will suggest a better description in the spec
      - Gary will update the tools use the document namespace approach
