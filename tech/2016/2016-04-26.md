    David's request
      - Text of the tag that specifies no file information included
      - Some additional information requested (see the email thread)
      - Yev will add as a bug to track

## Review of April 5 actions

  - External ID's
      - Need to update the document to include the regular expressions
        for all included ID's
      - Split regex into 2 columns - field descriptions and regex
      - Kate will take a pass at the table
      - Bill will verify the regexes (e.g. no spaces allowed)
      - Move into spec

## 2.1 Spec

## RDF terms inconsistencies in the relationship types

  - Yev will make sure there is a bug

## RDF terms documentation not in Spec

  - Cardinality of disjunctive and conjunctive license terms
      - Already in spec based on the definition of license expression
