## External References

  - Should we have the external reference be split into 2 sections - one
    at the top of the doc and one in section 3
      - Will follow-up with Bill on the proposal and close on it later
        (skipping section 2.12 for now)
  - Starting to like the idea of splitting out the external reference
    type definitions in a document section
      - Going through examples to make sure we are comfortable
      - Git example on the scratchpad
      - Debian example
          - various ways to get to the same package in Debian (e.g.
            browse through the URL, use apt-get)
          - Suggest we include multiple external repository ID's for
            Debian which use the different routes (e.g. one for browsing
            and one for apt-get)
          - Ask Debian for preference
  - Need add specific format for external repository ID's to distinguish
    local external repository references vs. pre-defined external
    repositories

Next week's call - topic will be license templates - will be one hour
earlier - Kate will send out the email on the logistics
