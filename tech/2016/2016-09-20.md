## License XML

  - Proposal to use JSON-LD rather than XML
      - More straightforward mapping to the current RDFa
      - Could replace the RDFa
      - May not be natural for the markup formats
      - May not be easy to human edit
      - Would be a lot of work to change the legal input format from the
        current XML
          - Could be programmatically changed
      - Follow-up – example? Study the formats, schedule future
  - Suggestion – adding RDFa for licenses, extending the current
    properties to include the equiv. of snippets for licenses to refer
    to sections of the text
      - This would allow a 1:1 mapping to RDFa
  - Reviewed the terms – notes are documented in the google doc at
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9n44xLH2MxT576KS_AbTOBtecyl5cw6RsrrQHibQtg/edit?usp=sharing>
