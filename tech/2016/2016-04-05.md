  - Discussion on requirement to have a package in every SPDX document
      - Has been an assumption in the past
      - Cardinality - Package
      - Correction use case - just refer to another SPDX document that
        has the package and make a correction
      - Need a describes relationship
      - Currently not specified
      - Can be implemented in the 2.1 spec
          - use a describes relationship with a document - only requires
            an SPDX element, could be a file or any item. If a package
            is not present, the describes relationship must be
            specified. Need to update the example in describes.
          - Already supported according to top level section 3
  - Discussion on the cardinality of the packageVerificationCode being
    dependent on the has files field
      - Cannot use the OWL constraint
      - Discussed possibly requiring the verification code but changing
        the algorithm
          - Possible algorithm is to use blank SHA1 if no files
      - Agree that the spec will take precedence and the constraints
        will need to be programmed into the tools for RDF (no change to
        spec)
  - Discussion on external IDs
      - Debian is still open - generic proposal (does not include the
        distro version)
          - Problem that the current Debian spec is not entirely unique
            - need the distro version to make it precise
          - Even with the problem, it is likely good enough - there are
            other mechanisms to make sure the package is unique (package
            verification code, download location, checksum)
  - Target date - Plugfest at Linux Con in August - Target spec June
    completion
  - Discuss CPE use case of a preliminary CPE - should it be a query of
    a pre-existing ID?
      - Desire for it to be an ID - semantics
      - Could be used as a query based on the spec today
          - Concern that not having the ID specified may be missleading
      - Resolve as a best practice
      - Request to follow-up with Robin on the use case
