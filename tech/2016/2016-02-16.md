## Package External ID's Proposal

  - Proposal at
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6LWnkh5GbMV9Xo5_zJ0wTNLROEIa4o1OU279YueI90/edit>
  - Restructured document similar to the license list - previous section
    2.12 is no its own section
  - Discussion on external reference list version - Kate will review
  - External Reference - Should we have a delimiter between repository
    and ID?
      - Specific to the repository type - hard to choose a single
        delimiter character that may not be used
      - Proposal to follow the pattern for section 2.6 - external
        document references
          - First space is a delimiter
          - Everything after the first space up until the end of line is
            the repository
      - Do we restrict it to one line?
          - Debian example where multiple lines may desireable
          - We can always add <text> in later and not loose backwards
            compatibility
          - Decided on one line - will re-evaluate adding <text> in the
            future
  - External Reference Location
      - Should it be section 9 or section 6?
      - 6 is already used in the spec
      - Updated text in section to indicate that all mandatory fields
        must be present after the ID
  - ID Format
      - Should we remove the "+"
          - Doesn't have the same issue as license ID
          - Should we be consistent with the license ID?
          - License refs will no longer allow "+" in version 2.1 of the
            spec
          - Decide to be consistent with the license ID - no + allowed
  - Category discussion 3.21
      - Should this be in the package instance area or part of the
        external reference (currently section 6 and spdx external
        reference list)
      - Relationship type is instance specific
      - Proposal:
          - Add externalReferenceCatagory to the external reference
            section to denote categories that are associated with the
            externalReference
          - Add comment to the externalReference (currently section 6)
          - Leave the category in section 3 as an "override" - change
            cardinality to optional
      - Proposal was not confirmed in the meeting - Request for some
        specific examples - for next week
