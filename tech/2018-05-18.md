## Version 2.1.1

  - Moved to gitbook alternative (gitbook is no longer open source and
    the current tools are broken)
  - New tool used is MKDocs <http://www.mkdocs.org/>
  - Some additional clean up on consistencies were done by Thomas:
    Updated the IDString inconsistencies and "<tag:value>"
    representation inconsistencies
  - Need to fix the PDF - Need to fix links and long tables
  - Next steps: Review HTML version - linked in the main github page -
    <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/>
  - Figure out how to publish to spdx.org specification - Gary to work
    with Jack
  - Add "Draft" to spdx version for the github.io pages - Thomas will
    work on this for next week

## Additional spec discussions

  - Discussed the branching strategy
      - Agreed master is the latest released
      - One branch for each branch in progress named for the release
      - Branches will be merged to master on release
      - Older releases will be tagged
      - Discussed if we wanted to maintain more than one active branch
        (e.g. both 2.1 and 3.0). Tradeoffs between managing the merges
        and having access to more current release versions were
        discussed. Did not come to a conclusion, decided to postpone the
        decision.
  - Github.io will point to the latest release and in-progress

## Issue \#35 - additional annotation types

Reviewed with Thomas issue \#35 - Agree with the approach documented at
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-rQCrJlu1GGmYFXFu17dxKbYlrMqVTwZwdYJNStPK-o/edit>
as long as the cardinality for the annotation type/subtypes is multiple

## Next Week

Next week - Discuss if annotations should apply to licenses as well as
SPDX documents, files, and snippets
