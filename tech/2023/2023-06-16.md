## Notes

- discussion on the fields: declaredLicense, concludedLicense
  - definitions and uses
- should a producer authoritatively "declare" what license a software is ?
- moving to properties vs. relationships
- adding more (newer) concludedLicenses is a common case
- even declaredLicenses get updated regularly (better tools, more human input, ...)
- relationships can handle updates/new info much more easily (practicality)
- if you want to add something new, do you AMEND the previous relationship?
  - this means adding a relationship ("AMENDS") to relationships
  - yes, ths is the way, and it's nothing special for licensing info -- any update works the same
- alternatively, it might be easier to generate a "new" SBOM with only the new info
- there are use cases for both: keep only new or also keep history
- our model allows both
- conclusion: both declared and concluded have the same requirements
- they must be handled the same

DECISION
Go with Relationships between software artifacts and licensing info.
