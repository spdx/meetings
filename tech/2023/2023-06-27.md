## Notes

* Logistics
  * Do we have a meeting next week on July 4? Agreed to skip
  * extra meeting in Japan-friendly timeslot.  One hour earlier (15:00 UTC), Tue 11 July. Gary to confirm with people from Japan

* Licensing profiles
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/394
  * Licensing profile depends on classes defined in ExtendedLicenseing profile
  * maybe move all expanded licensing classes to expandedLicensing profile (With, OrLater, etc.), and leave only LicenseExpression in Licensing profile
  * need also CustomLicense!
  * maybe have a SimpleCustomLicense in the licensing profile, with only a "licenseText: xsd:string" property
  * Arimn to create a PR about it to check details

* compacting creation information – issue #306
  * is it a model or serialization issue?
    * serialization compaction approach  Issue #357
    * model change  “unbundled” or individual profile #343
    * or maybe move it to a payload (header) #375

* Spelling change fix approved.
