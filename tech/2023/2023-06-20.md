## Notes

* Summary of Serialization meeting
  - essentially two approaches: one more JSON-LD, one more JSON
  - need a list of problems/concerns/objections for the two approaches
  - Alexios volunteered to set up list and share link with group for collaboartion on this topic

* Summary of the tech meeting about licensing info
  - both declaredLlicense and concludedLicense relationships instead of properties
  - Objections? None expressed
  - DECISION: use relationships for declaredLicense and concludedLicense

* Demo of the specification generation capabilities
  - mkdocs to the spdx-3-model repo
  - general sections
    - Using SPDX (like security Annex)
    - Implementors (e.g. serialization)
    - Specification:
        - page per Class/Property...
        - table of properties
        - examples: yaml json
  - connection to GitHub repo
    - can show different versions
  - using MkDocs Material -- needs sponsorship

- Namespace map
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/390
  - NamespaceMap, as it is currently defined and understood
  - serialization level namespace shortening is applied while parsing and hidden away from user,
  - does not map to serialization specific namespace shortening features (especially RDF does not work with it)
  - seems to have consistency issues, e.g. if elements are in multiple collections

* Action Items
  - Follow Up 06.13 re: meetings calendar (Rob)
     - Inventoried/cross referenced with GitHub and Groups.io calendars
     - (2) reminders active for all meetings
