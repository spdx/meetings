## Notes

* Proposal to adopt current standard as written. (joke)
  * Not passed.
* FOSEM updates
  * Nothing about OpenVEX or other VEX
  * On SBOM devroom, most presentations about SPDX; only one used CycloneDX
* Serialization
  * Only document or any object / element?
  * Ability to combine / appended payloads into a single document
* Done with logical model
  * Focus on serialization
  * Different sub-groups are interested in different serializations; work in parallel and present result to the group
* Canonical serialization (Sebastian)
* Serialization proposal, compatible with and includes canonical, but accommodates any independent element serializations:  https://github.com/davaya/spdx-3-model/tree/serialization/serialization
  * Mentioned Syft (https://github.com/anchore/syft) is discussing how to serialize licenses
* Documents / payloads can be combined, but hashes will become incorrect.
  * Trust that the information was transferred correctly.
* After canonicalization the hashes will be persistent.
* 3.0 can have elements from different namespaces.
