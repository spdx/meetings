## Agenda

  - Review instance diagrams
  - SPDX 2.0 next steps and discussion

## Instance Diagrams

  - Walking trhough spdx-2-0-jar-supply-chain.pdf
  - Discussion on git repo - agree that SPDX refers to a specific
    "snapshot" or "commit level" and not a more general reference
  - Patch use case - spdx\_2 is a description of the changes
  - binary / maven use case - maven url may point to a collection of
    files, not just a single jar
  - distribution - distribute a tarball - artifactof needs to be
    extended to describe the relationship
  - application which uses open source described by SPDX -
  - Discussion on the references to other SPDX docs - are the references
    to the doc, the element within the doc or both?
      - Both
      - Need to define the namespace
      - Need to include the concept of dynamic libraries where the
        artifacts are not copied, but the licensing is impacted by the
        reference - would be good to have an instance
  - What's missing from the current model:
      - SCM - may need more detail than in the current model
      - Patch - additions/deletions of artifacts
      - Relationships
          - do we need user defined relationships?
          - Does the relationship itself need more of a model?
  - Walking trhough spdx-2-0-jar-supply-chain-DocSharing.pdf
      - Diagram describes just what needs to be delivered to fully
        describe the delivered software from the right side of the
        previous diagram
      - Dotted lines are optional - would not need it if the docs were
        signed and available
  - Discussion on what SPDX document are included
      - do we need to include SPDX docs for files which are not
        distributed (but are used in creating the files which are
        distributed)?
      - Patch documents which show deltas?
      - URL references for docs - does that imply the document is
        accessible on the internet?
          - If it is internal, the doc should be included, if external
            it may go stale
      - Will the model support exclusions in the relationship?
  - Next Steps
      - Compare to current model - Gary
      - Try using protoge to model the properties for SPDX 2.0 - Bill
      - Start plugging the new properties into the current model - Gary
