## URL’s for beta

  - URL’s – Reviewed Kirsten’s email on the URL’s. Agreed with the
    proposal except the URL for rdf terms – agreed to leave the rdf
    terms URL as <http://spdx.org/rdf/terms> for beta
  - Remove reference to an RDF terms page (spec should be sufficient)
  - Examples – stay under spec/examples
  - Templates: Agreed to have the spreadsheet just under the tools
    directory (we don’t currently need a separate template area)

## Review of open priority 1and 2 bugs

  - None blocking beta.
  - License text – we believe this is not an issue for beta
  - License repository – Gary to send an updated set of files to Martin
  - Moving tools to the tools web page – Gary to move files today
  - Rename git repository to tools – Peter will rename to “tools”
  - Tag/Value example – Either Kate or Peter will produce
  - Examples – Agree that the examples should all pass the validation
      - Copy the spreadsheet example from the tool
      - Peter will regenerate some of the prior examples with the
        current spec
  - Verification algorithm – need to make sure it is in the spec. We
    could also add a Wiki page just for the algorithm.
