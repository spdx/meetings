## License Expression Language

  - Mark will email Kate the word doc with the current proposal
  - Kate will upload to a Google doc. for sharing

## File Tagging

  - Reviewed Jack's proposal
  - Agreed to the text for Jack's proposal
  - Proposal to use the tags for more than just the license ID
      - Would imply a format that makes it easy to translate (e.g.
        SPDX.\[tag\]:)
      - Agreed not to change the tag name from SPDX-License-Id since it
        is already in use
      - In the future, we could extend and perhaps use SPDX- as the
        prefix
  - Agreed to update the source files for the SPDX tools with the tags
      - Kate will do a pull request
  - How to delimit the license ID's?
      - Parens are no longer required in the license expression
      - Also a problem in the tag/value
      - Several proposals
          - Use end of line to terminate
          - Use parenthesis to expressions beyond the single license IDs
          - Use <text> </text> tags
          - Use the end of comment
  - Add suggestion to declare a string variable with the tag/value pair
    to include in the binaries
      - Some concern we may want to hold off for now
      - Agree to hold off for one week - will discuss next week
