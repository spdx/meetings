## SPDX Model Updates for SEVA fields

  - Discussed the vulnerability relationship to SpdxItem, Package, and
    File
      - Most vulnerabilities will be associated with package
          - NIST NVD’s can only be associated with packages
      - There are some scanners that will associate vulnerabilities with
        files
      - Agreed that we should associate the vulnerability to Item so
        that it can apply to both Package and File
      - vulnerability information is optional (0 to many)

## SEVA Vulnerability inclusion in SPDX

  - Most of the information is based on the NIST NVD definitions
      - Modeled after the definition documentation
      - A schema for the NVD which includes all of the details (e.g.
        scoring) does not exist (or at least we could not find one)
      - Names do not match the NVD names to support distinguishing an
        official NVD schema if one to be found or produced
  - Reviewed the SPDX-SECURITY schema at
    <https://spdx-ccm.specchain.org/xsdccm/home>
  - There is also an SPDX-SEC-ISM schema which includes classification
    information (ISM)
      - We agreed that the ISM information would be valuable to
        commercial use, but can be a separate decision from the
        vulnerability information
  - Discussed whether we should include all of the detail present in the
    SEVA document in the SPDX document or should we somehow reference an
    external document
      - There are a large number of fields to be reviewed
      - We are not vulnerability experts, and may not have the
        background to decide on a model and tools of our own
      - Agreed we should reference an external document
  - We agreed that the vulnerability information should be included
  - We discussed having a “proposal” or “working draft” similar to the
    W3C for the external document

## Next Steps in Vulnerability inclusion in SPDX

  - Gain a larger consensus on referencing an external document for
    vulnerabilities
  - Draft the external document reference language
  - Discuss / agree on the external reference content

## Documentation for SPDX including SEVA

  - James provided a document
  - Produced from the XML document
  - Extension to allow security classifications for each element (e.g.
    confidential)
      - Uses ISM schema
  - Discussion on approach
      - Document in sections vs get experience with proposed sections
        prior to specifying
      - Document in sections first is the traditional approach for SPDX,
        may have “culture shock” switching to a more prototyping
        approach
      - Danger in specifying first – may create implementation
        challenges and may create specs that are not widely used
  - Discussion on scope and prioritization
      - Large scope – many new sections and properties
      - Suggestion to prioritize by importance and ease of
        standardization
  - Discussion on the modeling
      - Agreed modeling will be helpful
  - Plan going forward:
      - Next week Mathew will review some of the new sections/areas
        being proposed and help prioritize which areas would be most
        useful
      - Next week’s call will focus on the use cases / prioritization
      - In 2 weeks, Gary will propose an update to the model which will
        include the higher priority areas/sections
