## SPDX 2.2

  - Broken diagrams
      - Kate is fixing the first the first one
      - Gary will update the model next week, we can go ahead and send
        out before the update if needed
  - ISO write onboard
      - Will do formatting
      - Need to add examples
      - Will invite the text writer into next call

## Profiles

  - Add an array at the document level with profiles; don’t need base
    since it is implied
  - Enum would require update spec, having a String would be more
    flexible
  - Another possibility is to assume a profile based on the “namespace”
    or what items
  - Consensus Profiles “set” with enumeration
  - Versioning of profiles
      - Should each profile have a version – similar to the license
        list?
      - Would we release different profiles at different times?
      - Thomas expressed interest in keeping it simple, only use SPDX
        versions – keep profile versions synchronized with SPDX version
      - Nisha raised the possibility of keeping a document manifest
      - We could support manifests using external document references
  - Discussion on simplicity
      - All agree this should be a guiding principle – we would want 3.0
        to be less complex than 2.2
      - Discussion on how important human writable/readable
      - Are there requirements to make sure we don’t make it “too
        simple”?
          - We can use the use cases to confirm?
          - Peter will create a document

## Linking and relationships

  - Links will be part of the base profile
  - Provenance elements part of the relationship
  - Consider having provenance information as properties of the
    relationships
  - Profiles could still describe the relationship required properties
  - Concept of strong and weak relationships
      - Strong relationship would include the provenance information
  - Inheritance vs containing
      - Inheritance would be less disruptive
      - Signing could be impacted
      - Should we pull in Grafeas to verify use cases and deployability
      - Schedule 2 Tuesday’s from now

## Software lifecycle proposal

  - Proposal for a format for SCM proposal
  - Similar to software product lifecycle
  - Very similar to work being done by Santiago
  - Scope is not just license compatibility, but also contractual
    compatibility
  - Would be a profile
  - Design principle – prefer SPDX stick to facts
