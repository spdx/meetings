  - 2.0 Use Cases

## Website

  - Proposal for changes to general meeting format and minutes page
      - Agreed to a format similar to the current business team pages
      - Need to update examples page –
          - rename current examples to 1.0 examples
          - restructure pages so that 1.1 is top level and the 1.0
            examples are archived
          - Examples for 1.1 need to be added
              - SPDX tool itself
              - Binutils (Mark Gisi)
              - Time

## Tools Document

  - Split the document so that the tool independent information is a
    separate high level doc
  - Updates to the document to correct URL’s etc
  - Separate information for submitting bugs and code to the tools
  - Git repository may have some issues
  - The tools doc needs to be update to point to git.spdx.org instead of
    the Linux foundation git repo

## 2.0 Use Cases

  - Yocto build use cases (see updated 2.0 use case Wiki page)
  - Re-look at the complexities that exist in some of the use cases –
    this can help drive what fields are mandatory and which fields are
    optional
  - Debian linking use case (see updated 2.0 use case Wiki page)
  - Michael will investigate the Debian build system

## Future agenda items

  - Future implementation ideas (e.g. Ed’s proposal)
  - Release schedule – should there be a 1.2?
