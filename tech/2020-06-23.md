## SPDX as a Package Manifest

  - Thomas added issue \#439
  - Minimal version of SPDX that can be included in the root of a
    directory for code that does not use a standard package manager
    (e.g. C/C++ projects that use makefiles)
  - What do we use for the document namespace?
  - What if we want to add a PackageVerificationCode or have
    FilesAnalyzed=true?
  - Could it be applied to Go binaries?
  - Can we use SPDX lite?
      - Different use cases, are the fields the same?
  - This will not be an additional section of the spec, but more
    guidance to the users of ORT

      - An issue and PR will be added to the spec
