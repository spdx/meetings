## Notes:

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC) - Gary
* Organization deadline is February 19
* we're good, application has been submitted
* Next steps: in next few weeks (March 9), will find out whether accepted, will be able to apply for # of slots
  * Will mostly depend on # of mentors
* Will review student submissions

### SPDX Online Tools - Gary and Steve
* Briefly discussed https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/issues/1191
* Gary to restart docker image to resolve

### Review MarkDown template - Gary and Alexios
* Reviewed Gary's proposal
* Question: how to proceed with SPDX 3.0 drafting process, so subteams can start drafting individual profiles?
* Reviewed draft MarkDown template for profiles
* Discussed adding "Includes Fields From" or "Inherits From" section, and/or table (for easier parsing), to include different properties to document subclass / superclass relationship
  * Discussed using "Subclass of ____" instead
  * Gary: intentionally chose words that _weren't_ RDF-related, to avoid implication that this would be tied to the semantically-correct definition when used here
  * Decided to postpone the decision on the name for later - we can do a global search/replace once decided
  * Agreed on including this field for now, to unblock profile drafters
  * Need to resolve what name will _eventually_ be; may change it later
* Discussed what to include when e.g. not a subclass?
  * may leave blank but may still need to keep section to maintain numbering
  * or, switch to table format that would be left blank
* "Used by" -- think this should include where this class is being used
  * "Used by" should be on the fields, not the class level
  * Decided to remove it from the proposal; can be derived later if needed
* Note: OWL document already exists; this is about connecting the Markdown to the OWL document, rather than starting with OWL and deriving everything from there
* Rather than having the drawings directly in the MarkDown, would prefer to have them generated
  * Alexios has a tool for this
* Data types -- two different types, data types and class types
  * For class types, should be limited to SPDX-defined class types
  * For "data types", should be limited to official XML schema data types, prefixed by "xsd:" (e.g.: "xsd:string")
* Attributes: "required" and "cardinality"
  * both are included primarily because of historical reasons
  * Discussed whether to remove or change one or both
  * Proposed: if concerns about the name "cardinality", suggested switching to "Min Count" and "Max Count"
* Field Name: anticipate that it will be a single field name that is the same across all formats?
  * currently not a solved problem
  * more general question of, how do we want to handle the different serialization formats in the documentation?
* OWL: concept of "sub-property"
  * used in SPDX, e.g.: SPDX Element has a property called "Name". Package also has a property called "Name". In tag-value, has to be called "PackageName" to know that it's the name of the element; the PackageName is a sub-property of SPDX Element "Name"
  * proposed "Sub-property of" to document this
  * Will include in template; optional
* "Format" field:
  * Currently, in OWL no way to handle these different specific formats (e.g. email addresses; "SPDX-M.N", etc.)
  * SHACL may help address this
  * and/or potentially provide regexes for these
  * Table should only have the actual format; prose details should be outside the table, in the "Description" section
  * Decided to use formal regex to represent this, rather than a description
* Gary to update this document based on today's conversation; will send out for review prior to next call
* Will continue conversation later about how to express / document the different serialization formats and other open issues

### Review combined model diagram - William
* William - shared first cut at merging the two model diagrams; sent previously at https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-tech/message/3982
* removed SPDX prefix from several things - e.g. "SPDXElement" => "Element"
* FileType in File: use media type, or existing enum from SPDX? consider having two separate ones, one for logical type and the other for physical type
  * some things from existing FileType enum could probably be removed b/c handled in physical type
  * consider keeping FileType as more "purpose of file" whereas ContentType becomes more "physical format of file"
* Mentioned "dataLicense" as CC0-1.0
  * Steve posted link to prior issue about this: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/159
  * question was raised about whether dataLicense should be at the Document level, vs. the Element level
  * noted risk of confusion from moving dataLicense to the Element level, where it may cause confusion with e.g. Declared License or Concluded License
* Completeness of relationships
  * In 2.2, enabled relationships to NONE and NOASSERTION to enable communicating completeness
  * In 3T discussions, switched to having this as a property on relationships
  * options: "the set is complete", "the set is incomplete", "we are making no assertions about whether it is complete"
* Discussed whether ExternalReference should itself be an SPDX Element, so that e.g. annotations can be made against it
  * Open issue, to be discussed
* Accidentally dropped "Annotations" from diagram; William will re-insert
* ExternalReference - proposed merging Category and Type
  * Gary: original idea was that there could be a repository of external references; category and type were hooks into this. May just want to merge these since that sort of repo hasn't panned out.
  * keep in mind that types should be extensible by profiles; at the core level, shouldn't make assumptions about profiles / use cases for the External Reference combined type
* Originator and Supplier
  * discussion in 3T group was to keep Originator as a property, vs. Supplier as a relationship
  * but -- outcome of that discussion may have been to keep simple by doing both the same way
  * Gary: believe it ended up with leaving Originator as property on artifact vs. Supplier as relationship
  * Discussed whether it should be max 1 for each, and/or any number.
    * Will see where definitions land before finalizing cardinality
* Suggestion: property naming
  * prefer singular names, even for items where can be multiple (e.g. "references" vs. "reference")
* Suggestion: property "type" on classes, will conflict in an ontology
  * shouldn't have the same name "type" being used different ways
  * e.g. "Relationship Type" or "Type of Relationship", rather than just "type"
* Suggestion: on Document, has "rootElement" pointing to top level -- (didn't catch the point here, but will be handled)
* Suggestion: "Completeness" discussion for relationships - many to many vs. one to many
  * many to many -- might be equivalent of listing out all the edges, but in many prior instances (outside SPDX / 3T) experience has been that the shorthand creates confusion
