## Notes

### Protege Training
- Alexio followed up
  - Currently being done onsite, at Stanford but they can offer online
  - 4 days 4 hours a day
  - Cost $30,000 minimum
  - Most likely too expensive
  - There is a new version of the tutorial
  - Suggest we go through the tutorial as a team
  - Tutorial link: https://www.michaeldebellis.com/post/new-protege-pizza-tutorial

### 3T & SPDX
- Kate provided an update where the 3T SBOM and SPDX efforts will be merged
- The core 3T SBOM group (working on the core model) will join into our calls next week.
- New voices on the weekly call.    Good modeling expertise.
- Expanding efforts out into different area.    New calls for integrity & defects.
- Divergence mostly resolved - technical side of standard lining up with SPDX 3.0
- Thomas will be taking over defects subgroup from 3T,  and discussion on what initial scope.   Work in progress is to merge defects to core.   Open question about scope.
- Defects base spec is possible approach - bring it in as a phased approache is under discussion.
- Lock down licensing spec.   Want to move to SPDX 3.0 as soon as possible
- Nisha suggests if we don't add linking profile until after.
- May want to have a staged approach here.     Core & Licensing & Base Security.    170 different standards, we won't be able to unify them.
- Steve - Getting Licensing out early be good, to move it forward.    Drafts and prior rounds --> github

###  SPDX 3.0

Formats
- Tooling discussion - pretty much resolved.
- WIlliam  - review/update UML model between now and next meeting.
- Gary - we need to standardize the template for markdown descriptions.  Can we build on what William has already done.
- Alexios - going through the tutorial on Protege.   Provide guidance to the rest of the team.
- Gary - to work out the tool workflow and provide overview

Process
- Markdown does not fully describe the model in sufficient detail to build tooling.
- Combination of editing in markdown and editing in Protege will be required.
- Tutorial:  https://www.michaeldebellis.com/post/new-protege-pizza-tutorial
- Language will be updated in Markdown.
- New fields?   may need some tooling.    Person proposing changes responsible for making sure it gets into protoge, and what can be copied over.
- Plan flow:  agree on a feature, discussion in markdown, then update the ontology in order to close the feature.

- Kate & Nisha: SPDX Element, SPDX Document, ExternalDocumentReference, Relationships
- William:  Artifact, Package, File, Snippet, Identity
- Thomas:  Defects
- Steve:  Legal

- We need to reconcile with ISO structure for template.
   - Summary Diagram (may want ignore for now), Metadata, Type, Fields, Examples
   - Each section should have a diagram, but we can do it after.
   - Pass:  Get Text and metadata in there,  then do a consistency pass.
   - William to take a pass at incorporating Rex's
   - Rose to do external reference.


   Work will happen in development/v.3.0 --> this will have 2.2.1 base in it, and we will adjust the repository.
   New files for the profiles.

   William to do pass to clean up base for contribution.

   1 markdown file per class
   1 file per profile
   decide what we want to merge together later.

   Jim - work with Gary about checking for cross referencing of terms, to avoid redundant terms/synonyms.

   Ontology is at: http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spdx/spdx-spec/development/v2.2.1/ontology/spdx-ontology.owl.xml
