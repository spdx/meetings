## Notes

### Question re: NTIA comments followup
* Update from Bob
* NTIA - two roles: (1) facilitate community consensus efforts; (2) also preparing RFC followups
* Won't be directly referring to any of those inputs, but will be using them in determining their followup
* RFC doc: https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/frn-sbom-rfc-06022021.pdf
* Little nuances between group positions
* EO directive will not direct consensus although will be taken into account

### Update on GSoC tooling
* Gary is involved in
* Licensing managing in Python - good progress
* Moving online tools to Python3 - good progress
* Steve is involved in
* Golang tools - JSON parsing - great job
* just completed parsing now included in the main branch
* a few new issues related to the spec
* Alexios is involved in
* Tooling for the templates - Working on parsing the template markdown
* We don't expect to be able to generate everything but we'll make best effort

### Email re: spdx-sbom-generator project
* Thomas's email articulating concerning this tooling
* Also feedback regarding which projects in the org are active
* Next week when Kate is back this can be discussed
  * Does the SPDX community endorse any tools?
  * The tools for validating the syntax are good but we should not endorse the content of the generated documents
  * Scope for next week's conversation:
* Cruft in github org will be deferred

### Follow-up discussion on templates
* Sean raised concern on whether we had consensus on the proposed simplifications to the template
* Alexios transformed the model into the propsed template: https://github.com/spdx/spec-v3-template
* Most content in the element and document
* This is the writing format, this will be input into a tool that generates the ontology, markdown for reading (with tables), word document to be submitted to ISO, JSON-LD context, JSON Schema, XML XSD, RDF OWL, SHACL
* Question on how to have the conversation on the text
* Sean - likes avoiding the numbering; general agreement on the simple format
* Suggest being able to determine a file represents a class
  * Everything with a capital letter is a class
  * File named properties for the properties
  * File for vocabularies (name TBD)
  * Sean suggested a more explicit class name
  * Alexios suggested adding a directory for the classes
    * Agreement on the classes approach - separate files
    * Single file for properties, 2 files for data or object properties, or one file per property
      * Single file - but reccomend merging pull requests more quickly to avoid merge conflicts
* Question on whether numbering would be generated
  * It will be generated during the output
* Description of properties would be in a single separate file
* Each class can narrow the constraints on a property
  * For example, you can constrain a string to a specific Regex
* All text / prose for a property would be in the properties file
* Profiles would not add properties to class etc.  - that would be done in the model and the profile would specific the restrictions
* Analogy to legos - legos defined in the model, profile specifies if you want to use the legos for this use case, this is how you do it
* Confusion on the Core profile - if it is in the model as a restriction
* Bob - OMG uses compliance points; profiles are a different
* Do we want to use profiles for "information hiding" to aid simplicity to the reader of the spec
* Suggestion we add to the profile document properties and classes relavant to profile
* Simplify searilization would a be key
* How do we document serialization examples?
  * This would be separate from the model
  * One per serialization
  * Can we generate?
  * Some details in addition to the shapes would be needed (David)
    * Shape lists the attributes, but doesn't list the collection properties (ordered, unique)
    * Would want different serializations that support ordering to have the same ordering
    * Could have order be the order in the spec as the suggested order, but not require ordering
    * Need to add, needs add at the "end", what about multiple profiles?
      * Solved by using the model / core as the order
        * Would require serializations that require the order to leave empty fields empty (example spreadsheet)
  * seralizations should all require version and profile information
    * For ordered serializations, suggest leaving space for additional terms
    * May need to add additional information on what additional classes are added
  * Binding rules would be separate
    * Can use different formats to define the binding rules
* Github spdx spec question:
    * Work being done on separate repo
    * Plan would be to bring this back into the spdx-spec
* Quesiton on property name collisions (2 classes use same property name with different meaning)
   * Agree we should avoid name collisions


## Parking lot for next week
* Should we separate out the spec into separate documents?  SPDX 2.2 is getting quite large.
* Serialization for ordered lists (e.g. protocol buffers)
* Should we create a new repository for the 3.0 specification? The repo structure due to new template will be quite different and relicensing the old repo might be difficult.
* spdx-sbom-generator project update from Kate
* External document reference in 3.0
  * Example for Golang project in SPDX 2.2: https://github.com/swinslow/spdx-examples/pull/28
  * Steve will be reviewing and merging this  :)  Need to do a couple of other fixes that have emerged for the other examples in that repo.
