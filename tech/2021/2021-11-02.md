## Agenda
* OCI Artifacts use case (Steve)
* Concerns: Multiple artifacts of different types located in container registries. The references for these artifact types include a location (a domain). This prevents artifacts from moving from
* All interaction with the artifacts are basically API calls from a client
* (Some conversation about Notary V2)
* SPDX ID is an IRI is not the identifier of the artifact but the IRI of the description of the artifact
* There can be conflicting perception of the content. It's the same artifact but different content
* Different organizations may interpret the artifact differently at various points in time
* It is chosen by the creator of the element
* All artifact types have an artifact URL and it is intended to be a superset of package url (different artifact namespaces) (Eg: book:ISBNnumber). They can be the same or comparably the same.
* External references: point to arbitrary external identifiers - just identifiers (Eg: CPE for NVD, attaching CPE to an artifact; Additional purls can be added to external references)
* External Map points to any SPDX Element not just documents
* Purpose of External Map is to pull an external element into the scope of the current Collection
* External Map could meaningfully be named External Element <-- would this mean removing "defining document"?
* Notary v2: detached signature allows validating who signed content before admitting that content into environment
* Whether or not individual elements can be verified has not been closed on yet, but during transmission the data is contained within a physical file which can be hashed, signed and verified.
