## Discussion on Appendix V: Using SPDX short identifiers in Source Files

  - Alexios pointed out that there are several source files that have an
    SPDX identifier and continues with additional license text
      - This causes issues for tools that expect the SPDX identifier to
        be the sole expression of a license for that file
  - Discussion on how to add/represent/resolve additional text
  - Discussion on substantial modifications made to files which have
    additional licenses
  - REUSE has recommendations that seem to resolve this issue
  - Current text in Appendix V does not reflect these recommendations
  - Alexios to create a PR as a proposal
  - Steve will review the PR and comment
