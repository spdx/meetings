## Core 3T SBOM comparison

  - Comparison of Core 3T model to Core SPDX model
  - Slides available at
    <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dvGeCAbOUSD5qFQ6mt1WsnBEZvatnonYpKGdAQCIWZg/edit#slide=id.g95424fd354_0_0>
    (NOTE: presentation starts a slide 8)
  - Similar models
  - Proposed changes to SPDX
      - Identity – add structured email field, add structured tool
        information
  - Relationship
      - Subclass of element – adds ID
      - add completeness enum
          - Should completeness be put in a separate profile?
          - General consensus on the call 95% of use cases will not use
            this so should be added as a profile
          - Agreed to defer the decision until Kate is on the call –
            Kate has been working with NTIA on this
          - David raised the point that completeness is an optional
            enumeration and may not complicate the model
          - Desire to simplify by reducing the number of field
            definitions
      - Make the object independent of the 2 items being related
  - Package URL more fundamental – mandatory unique identifier
      - Expanded the URL to be and ArtifactURL – superset of PackageURL
        which can include other types of artifacts including hardware
        etc.
      - concern about representing non-public package distribution; PURL
        may not be mature enough for all use cases
          - add to the PURL or ArtifactURL if it is missing
          - Software heritage approach could be another alternative –
            less human readable
          - Could we use the SPDX reference ID as a package URL
  - Additional HASH algorithms
  - Suggestion to create examples for various scenarios (e.g. here’s the
    source repository a binary artifact was built from)
  - Suggest that we also have “bad examples”
  - Nisha created a mock-up for a container as part of defining the
    linking profile
      - Describing the relationships between layers, manifests can be
        complicated
      - Difficulty in representing URL for container metadata
      - Dynamic systems that re-generate the artifacts
      - Proposal that the SBOM travel with the artifacts in the
        distributed systems

## How to document different profiles

  - ran out of time for this topic – moved to next week

## Next Week

  - Linkage profile update
  - Nisha to present challenges with adapting to the container /
    container registry work
  - How to document different profiles
