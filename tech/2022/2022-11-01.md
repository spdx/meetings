## Agenda
* Consent agenda from Friday's meeting
* Snippet's location will be defined by byte range and/or line range and byte range takes precedence if there's a conflict
* downloadLocation will only be on Package, external references can be used to add download location to other elements
* homePage will only be on Package and will be singular, external references can be used to add additional links to Packages or to other elements
* packageUrl will only be on Package (no artifactUrl on Artifact), external identifiers can be used to add additional identifiers to Packages or to other elements
* Concept of a content identifier may be added in 3.0 or 3.1 that allows linking a gitoid to different artifacts, Sebastian to create a proposal and Jeff to review from a gitbom perspective
* Content identifier will be a property in snippet, file, package, not using external identifier. Gitoid will be the content identifier.
* DocFest update
* Build Profile: Package encoding env variables / Runtime element?
* Questions to Core from SPDX Defects Profile
* SPDX 3.0 Punch List


## Minutes

### Consent Agenda
* Discussion on the Content Identifier - concern if we don't allow for Class to describe the content
* Discussion on the homePage/PackageUrl - Concern with the principal of having a property for the primary as opposed to having a property on the External Reference to denote one of may of these references being primary
  * Agree to move forward with the proposal and revisit the principal as a whole during a final review of the model

### Docfest
* 22 responses, Go, Python are popular languages
* One response covered a lot of languages we don't have targets for
* Targets tentatively decided - Go, Python, Ruby, Java Maven, Java Gradle, Rust
  * C# - William will get some help - will include .Net
* Thomas created https://github.com/tsteenbe/sca-sbom-tests to test SCA tools based on ORT tests - Probaby too much to include in this Docfest, but something to consider in next Docfest.
* Ivana will send out an update with the current targets.  With additional targets being added, we may/will likely extend the deadline.

### Build Profile: Package encoding env variables / Runtime element
* Question on if Packages can express things like windows registry
* William will check - current thinking is windows registry file that can be included in a package
* Suggestion to consider - should an environment be an SBOM rather than a package?
* Some discussion of an Environment BOM (EBOM) that describes a runtime environment
* Suggestion to create a relationship to an SBOM element
* Perhap inherit from BOM instead - would be more generic

### Questions to Core from SPDX Defects Profile
* Example of linking to an SPDX ID in another document
  * Example in the model diagram - SBOM Example JSON
* Confusion on the model diagrams in minutes - Gary will delete
* What of the below options are available to a profile? If yes, what is the recommendation to implement the option
  a) Making properties in SPDX core elements optional or mandatory
    * Profiles can add constraints, but can not add or make optional if mandatory
  b) Adding new properties to SPDX core elements
    * Proposal to not allow adding new properties in profiles - should be added in core
    * Discussion on using relationships over properties
  c) Changing ENUM in data types
    * Open punchlist item as to whether ENUMs can be extended - TBD
  d) Changing properties in SPDX Core data types
    * Same as b) above
* Request for guidance from Core team on what can be added / modified in profiles
  * Perhaps some documentation
* How do we model actors?  e.g. someone creates, someone reviews
  * either a property or relationship
  * example - supplier is a relationship and originatedBy is a property

### Continuing SPDX 3.0 Punchlist discussion
* Gain concensus and clarity on type of extension element. (clarify - Map<IRI, any> Structure or dictionary map?
  * IRI is the IRI for the class definition and any is the actual class implementation
  * Need to have further definition
  * Alternative to having this structure is just use a String (or array of bytes)
  * Questions on canonicalization - follow-up item for the canonicalization group to come back on this items
    * What if the schemas for the extensions are not available to the tools?
    * Canonicalization of unknown extensions requires the ability to serialize elements independently of semantics, based on a small set of core types.  An information model defines that small set, e.g., https://github.com/davaya/ocsf-im/blob/main/images/ocsf-jadn.png, https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T9PuXVwaw8AlUB48Xt_TDL9K1GFQvZSpjpnFUB7Mrc8/
  * Everyone in between the producer and consumer of the extension should not have to know the schema for the extension [consensus]
