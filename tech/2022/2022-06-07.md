### Other news
* Reproducible Builds mentioned SPDX in their monthly newsletter: https://reproducible-builds.org/reports/2022-05/

### Snippets in Source File
* Matija reviewed proposal: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/464#issuecomment-1140023288
* Goal - include snippet information in source files
* Need 3 things
  * mark a license
  * mark a copyright
  * mark the beginning and end of a license
* Begin and end tag - to proposals - one with identifiers, one without
* Specify allowed character sets
* For the names tag, the scope of tag names are only within the file they are found
* Each name would be unique within that file/scope
* No semantics implied by the name
* Option 3 - make the names optional -
  * In the nested case, it is still optional
* Discussion on syntax - Henk raised the point we are mixing variable names in the tags
* New proposal - SPDX-SnippetBegin: id, SPDX-SnippetEnd: id
* Maximilian raised the concern that it is harder to read and parse with the ID's
* Discussed pro's and con's between two proposals:
  * 1) SPDX-SnippetBegin: id    SPDX-SnippetEnd: id
  * 2) SPDX-SnippetBegin   SPDX-SnippetEnd
* Votes
  * Maximilian: Strong favour for option 2 (simple tags are important)
  * Gary: favour for option 1 (for easier validation)
  * Alexios: favour for option 1 (easier debugging)
  * Ivana: favour for option 1 (easier validation)
  * Henk: favour for option 2 (less state, only one possible value)
  * Matija: ambivalent
  * Sebastian: ambivalent

* Several preferred option 1 to make validation eaiser
* Discussion on copy/paste of files - having begin end ID's make it easier to validate, but does may cause non-unique ID's
* Gary changed his vote to #2 due to the non-unique names
* **No one felt strongly for #1, so we concluded on option #2 for the syntax.**
* Alexios pointed out that Annex H needs to be updated to document the begin/end snippet tags as the way to demarcate beginning and ending of lines
* Copyright text - SnippetCopyrightText is proposal - already in the spec.
* Proposal to use just CopyrightText - or FileCopyrightText
* **Agreed to use SnippetCopyrightText.**
* Copy/Paste issue discussed - could even use SnippetCopyrightText and snippet tags even the whole file is the snippet
* License info tag - 3 options proposed in Matija's comment - SPDX-License-Identifier is already in Annex H -
* TODO:
  * PR for Annex H - Matija -
  * Naming convention inconsisty with REUSE - Sebastian will bring this up
  * Legal team to review - Gary to follow-up with Jilayne and Steve

### 2.3 Cleanup
* Pending PRs for 2.3 (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A2.3)
  * KS:  recommend #671 (Usage Profile) be moved to 3.0, and https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/709 be accepted (subset of #671 fields).
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/708
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/707
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/706

* Outstanding issues (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A2.3) KS: I think that some of these have been resolved and can be closed now?
* Discussed https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/587 - no volunteers, probably won't get fixed for 2.3
  * Can be published outside the spec
