### Identity discussion
* William, Gary and Sean met on Friday to discuss details about the identity aspects of SPDX 3.0.
  * Actor class can be concrete
  * Tool inherits from Actor - separate from Identity
  * Identity is also concrete - can be used if you don't know if the identity is a person or organization
  * Actor is a subclass of element - allows relationships
  * Can aways use an Identity in place of an Actor since it is a subclass of Actor
  * An Actor's creator can be itself (self-referencing)
* Discussion on self referential potential issue
  * would be only self referential which would be easier to deal with
* Discussion on correlation
  * Difficulty in correlating based on strings
  * Current identity proposal still has identity strings that need to be correlated
* Question on how we distinguish an Identity being used as something other than Actor
  * Dashed lines on the diagram describe additional Ontology subclasses
  * Solid lines are used for inheritance
* Question - can there ever be an element of type Actor
  * yes - there are use cases where this would occur - when you don't know the identity
* This proposal adds a requirement that every Element requires an additional Element for createdBy
  * Concern this would create issues in scenarios such as a streaming use case
  * This is also an issue with other elements
  * This would be the first time the Element is in a required field
  * A creator is always known when creating an SPDX document
  * creation information is still a Struct and has to be in the same document
  * actors referenced by a creation info can now be separated into a separate "document"
  * identity isn't used by createdBy since tool is a subclass of Actor and createdBy can be a tool
  * No objections to moving forward with the current proposal based on the above issues
* Do we presume that identity is mapped to an identity management system?
* What if we only have an "identifier"?
  * Since Actor is an element, it has an ExternalIdentifier property
  * Should Identity be abstract?
    * This would allow us to have information that can map to external identity providers
* Henk - views Tool not as a subclass of Actor
  * Sean - Scope of Actor is some entity that Acts
  * Solving for the larger scope would be challenging - would like to scope to a smaller
* Discussion on a simpler model where we have a single representation of the Actor/Identity/Tool/Person/Organization with "Entity" - "Entity" would have a property which would have a type
  * David proposed this would be a simpler type
  * Sean expressed strong concerns the simplification - would not allow easy distinctions between identity types
* Last proposal - "Entity" superclass for Tool/Identity Identity superclass for Person and Organization
* Sebastian still has a concern on the Actor/Identity/Entity being a separate Element that may cause inconsistency in producing/consuming SPDX documents
