## Agenda

* Punch List: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/29

## Notes

### Enumerations
* Conflict between saying enumerations are closed and profiles can add enumerations
* Hash algorithm enumerations - should it be possible to add new values as they come up
* Profiles will want to extend enumerations
* Proposal to separate out 2 categories:
    * Extensions by profiles managed by SPDX subgroups
    * Extensions by anyone
* Extensions by profiles managed by SPDX subgroups:
    * Could have a single superset of enums
    * This is consistent with how we plan to manage other aspects of the core and profile models
* Proposal to have a registration for enum values, e.g. IANA - this would allow it to be open
   * Pro's - more visibility - amplifier for use
   * Con's - SPDX may not have as much control over the list of values
     * License identifiers, managed by SPDX, has a robust process and is highly adopted
* Question on releasing profiles - independent of main release?
  * Current thinking is that release would sync up with core profile releases
* Discussion on release process - proposal we start with synchronized release of profiles and core, but could make them more independant in the future
* Note profiles are versioned - so technically, they can be released independenty, but process wise we would start with synchronized release
* Profile version discussion:
    * Allows for different profiles to maintain different versions - would allow for asynch release
    * Downside - adds complexity to validation
    * Immutable elements will be under a profile and once created, the version can't change
    * Strong concerns expressed with managing multiple versions in the tooling - similar to dependency hell in software development
    * Proposal 1 - Profiles will have versions in the logical model, but for the forseeable future, profile versions will be in sync with the spec version
    * Proposal 2 - Remove the version from profiles, profiles will always be released in lock step with the SPDX spec.  Implication, changing this would be a breaking change - so we are essentially deciding that profiles and specs will be release together until at least 4.0 (which allows breaking changes)
    * Decision: Proposal 2 - remove version from profiles

### Software Dependency Relationship
* Proposal to subclass Relationship with a SoftwareDependencyRelationship
* Advantage - reduces the total number of relationships
* Disadvantage - Another abstract class to deal with in tooling and a different way of querying the graph
* Decision - Add NONE to the fields along with Unknown
* Question on "Environment" - Want to be careful we're not mixing orthogonal concepts
  * Suggest "Scope" rather than "Environment"
  * May need more work on clarifying the terms such as Environment/Scope
