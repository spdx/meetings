## Notes
- GSoC
   - Submittal quality was not very high
     - Similar problems with other GSoC projects - not unique to SPDX
  - Two projects qualify
    - Private license repository - standard web based system, not very heavy in SPDX
    - SBOM Conformance Checker
  - Need a mentor for Java SBOM Conformance Checker;  probably new command line tool.
  - Nisha curious about choice of programming in Java,  Thomas points to university.
  - Sebastian willing to help with CLI aspect.  If contributor work with Python,  Nisha willing if co-mentor.
