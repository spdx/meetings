## Agenda
* Data license field
* Comments field in creation info
* Examples:
    * JSON or JSON-LD?
    * Element Array
    * IdentifiedBy
* DownloadLocation (Package), Locator (ExternalIdentifier) - identifier (purl) or locator?

## Notes

* Data license: it's defined to be CC0-1.0
* Use Comment in CreationInfo to add information about the SBOM (e.g., a legal disclaimer)
* IdentifiedBy was renamed to ExternalIdentifier
* ExternalIdentifier uniquely identifies the element
* DownloadLocation should be fetchable
* DownloadLocation could refer to latest version, is not always an identifier
* CPE for Python may not distinguish between unique ID (pure python) or architecture-specific
* Example property names @id, @type do not imply JSON-LD conformance

* Payload root does not have IRI, does have creationInfo, imports, namespaces, and element array
  * Assertion: one SpdxDocument element with 50 IRIs can always replace 50 ExternalMaps - need to verify
  * Examples (Minimal and SBOM) should be instances of Payload
