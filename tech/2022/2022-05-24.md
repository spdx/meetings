- SPDX 2.3
   - Thomas:  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/682 - ready to merge?  Yes, done in call.
   - Thomas: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/679 - ready to merge?  comments addressed?
      - pending - still needs discussion between Thomas & Steve.
      - note:  will close https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/657
   - Thomas: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/670
   Kate: There were two pending items in PR 670 that did not get resolved when the PR was merged. I request that PR 670 be reopened and the two pending items have action taken (accept or reject) and then merge the pull request based on the consensus outcome of these two items. Here are the two pending items I'm referring to:

 1. rjb4standards Pending G.1.3.1 Linking to a CycloneDX Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) for a Software Product (see NIST SP 800-161r1 RA-5 and IEC 29147:2018 for VDR information)
"externalRefs" : [ {

2. rjb4standards Pending G.1.9 Linking to a Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) for a Software Product, (see NIST SP 800-161r1 RA-5 and IEC 29147:2018 for VDR information)
Use this method to reference an "impact statement" per the SECURITY advisory type, following the NIST VDR description.
"externalRefs" : [ {
  "referenceCategory" : "SECURITY",
  "referenceLocator" : "https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/blob/master/SBOM_and_VDRbaseline/sag-pm-118_VDR.json",
  "referenceType" : "advisory"
} ]
       - remove WIP & ready to merge?  Yes.  Done.
       - Does it makes sense to add in info requested https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/587 to the HOWTO?
           - Looking for volunteer to add a "how to" on Main component & SBOM generation.
   - William/Gary: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/630 status?  This will be resolved when issue 661 is resolved.
      - William - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/582 PR possible?
   - Alexios, Gary, Steve: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/681 - group concnesus.
       - License Namespaces  (first part of discussion here, and will be also discussed in Legal Call)
Use case
only in source code files
in SPDX Documents
Do we allow for a license namespace to reference when text is not present?
This is only for 2.3 at this point.   Can you refer to external licenses without external doc references.
Karsten:  find it redundant today, and some commericial are not able to share.
Philippe:  If private, don't care,   if public share so ids.  If spec says we have to have text inside, will cause repeating info.    Don't want to optimize for non-public use cases.
Gary: External doc ref applies to license ref, evolving opinion.   Note we can separate out the registration from external doc ref.    Should follow naming pattern that includes easy reference to namespace bing used.
Max:  Concern If I need to know hashes or other information, I can not generate an SPXD document for the single file, that just contains "LicenseId: LicenseRef-.example.com.-License-1" in the header?
Gary: Would require lookup location and hash.    Registration process for namespaces.   Standard syntax for external document ref.  Can use this to look up.   URI will be in SPDX document.
Format
dot-dash (domain)
dash-dash (organization)
nothing special(?) (as scancode already does)
Some concensus on the call to move to external doc ref.
License publishing -- where is the SPDX document
in SPDX project
outside SPDX project
not even a document(?) (scancode?)
Registration process
what checks will be done before "accepting"
Alexios - can't be just a random one, and should be able to be resolved
Max - concern about complexity in generation.
Philippe - just use license ref
Alexios - would require copying of licesning text.
Gary - need mechanism to find and verify.
Philippe - consider license expressions with these in them.
Registration publishing -- how the registered names will be published
list on GitHub
releases/versions?
Check if DocRef can be specified for licenses today?  yes!
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/671 - next steps?  Email
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/464 --> move to be in 3.0?   Yes, Given there doesn't seem to be closure yet.
- Ontology pending release candidate - Gary
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/547
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/501
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/618 - was this resolved in 2.2.2 or still pending for 2.3?
- Volunteers for 2.3 or move to 3.0?
   - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/636 --> 3.0
- Cleanups
   - Rose - can https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/593 be closed?   I think it's covered by your PR but want your input.
   - Closed https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/500 - reopen if idsiagree
   - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/395 Need to figure out next steps.


Issues:  421, 412  From discussion,  all the PRs are documentation changes now, so Gary is good to start with Ontology.
