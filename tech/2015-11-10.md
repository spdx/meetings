    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OknzNnY56UZhnj_VVPatirBrNze5cWXDx2fnKbBI_g/edit#heading=h.nmf14n>
  - Reviewed latest proposal
  - Snippet Names
      - Argument for name
          - Consistency with other SPDXItems and SPDXElements
          - Makes it easier for tools developers to common code if the
            model was consistent
          - It is possible that some of the snippets will be popular
            enough that a name makes sense
      - Arguments against name
          - No strong use case where comments could be applied to solve
            the use cases
      - It is important that it is optional
      - Agreed on the call leaving name in
      - Agreed it should be optional
      - Updated text for the intent to include consistency as one of the
        reasons
  - Review Snippet Comments
      - Agreed that it is fine - consistent with other use of comments
  - Discussed Olivier's comments on Snippets
      - We should make sure it is clear that Snippets are optional
      - The first statement in Snippets makes it sound like it is
        required
      - Suggest updating the first statement: "Optional", "when a
        snippet can be cleanly identified"
      - Updated first couple sentences in proposal
      - Follow-up with legal team to make sure the snippet use case is a
        valid use case
      - Use the JavaScript mash-up example - does not require
        interpretation
      - Kate has the action from General meeting to follow-up with
        Oliver
      - Gary will follow-up with Kate
  - No other snippet items were reviewed - Propose this as a candidate
