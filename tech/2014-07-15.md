## Recap from last week

  - Decided to use the minutes from Collab summit as the source for much
    of the spec updates rather than creating the RDF documentation
    first. The link to the minutes google docs:
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTMJsDZjDajacMK1P5qyP4Jib3bwhsYKxeuG4U5z1DE>
  - Discussed the verificationCode for related documents
      - should we call the verificationCode in the relationship -
        decided the term should be different. Will discuss once we have
        the complete proposal in bug 818

## SPDX 2.0 bugs

  - Only 4 open bugs targeted for SPDX 2.0 - there should be more
  - License expression language "or later" - assigned to Mark Gisi
  - Signing SPDX documents, decided to push after 2.0 - retargeting
  - bug 878 assigned to Jack - Jack will review and update the bug
  - JSON implementation - postpone past 2.0
  - bug 1010 - synchronizing the terms definitions between the spec and
    RDF - agreed on a process 2 weeks ago, closing the bug as resolved
