## Notes
- Implementation/Serialization
  - Looking for "Go expert" to review proposals for SHACL/Go bindings.    
  - Go bindings written in Go.

### Published spec issues
- Diagrams missing from the spec (filed as https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/959) - pull from https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/
- Core model tree really wants to be expanded (filed as https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/958).
- Version selector is out of visibility (filed as https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/939).

### Help for Examples
- Review request for https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/78
- Leads for AI & Dataset looking for examples to incorporate into their sections. 
- Kate looking for help on syntax for linking one SBOM to SBOM. 
- Put SPDX-3.0 directory under each software examples
  - Nisha to volunteering to do Example 7 for SPDX 3.
  - Need expert in serialization and JSON
  - Joshua is JSON expert - GitHub Actions need work

### Validation
- Online validator - Gary library for JSON - other targets welcome
  - Need another quarter, safe to say that it will be availble by the end of this year
- Joshua's tool, able to do first pass validator.
  - Need to make it visible in PyPI.
- JSON-LD - if test valid, any RDF library will do basic check.
  - RDFlib - will let you validate it's a JSON-LD document. Valid JSON - should also work.
- Generated bindings to do validation;
  - Validate against JSON schema published; validate against Python model.
- AI: Joshua to mail to tech list ways to do validation of preliminary SPDX documents. 
- AI: Maximillian to put link to tool to mailing list (or these minutes).
- AI: Add information on doing automatic validation to the examples repo or to the https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/main/serialization

- Where do we want to want to put description on how to do validation of SPDX 3.0 examples?
  - Options: Put in Serialization folder; Put in toplevel document in Examples Folder
    ("How to contribute examples - should include validating them")

### Emerging Tools
- Any emerging tools?
- Implementers call moving to weekly.
- Aiming for before next Yocto release.
- Tern depends on SPDX Python tools https://github.com/tern-tools/tern
- Online validator tools depending on Java tools & has dependencey on Python tools

### Security
- Looking for VEX annex review - Adolfo & Jeff

## Next call
- SPEC fix merges
- Go SHACL update from serialization - add information about abstract classes to the SHACL model?
- Decide about PR #950 (if not resolved before) for 3.0.1
