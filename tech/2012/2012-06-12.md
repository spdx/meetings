## 1.1 Discussion

  - [Bug 1023](https://bugs.linuxfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1023) -
    sec 5.4 terminology is inconsistent with RDF vocabulary used in
    license list
      - Spec will be updated to use rdfs:seeAlso
      - Tag will be LicenseCrossReference:
      - Will remove “canonical source” reference
      - Describing the cardinality – currently “Conditional (optional
        one or more)”. Inconsistent with LicenseComment. Proposal to use
        “Conditional (optional one or more)” for all cases for zero or
        more.
          - Proposal to add definitions of “Conditional”, “Mandatory”
            and “Optional”
  - Bug xxxx – standard license list:
      - Additional terms have not been discussed
      - Currently, terms have been used on the standard license
      - Agreed that we need to discuss and document the terms
      - Will discuss this next week
  - Comments in the document
      - RDF serialization has its own comment format (e.g. RDF/XML
        comments would be \<\!—comment --\>)
      - If using tag/value, ‘\#’ only starting on column 1 – will add to
        spec documentation
      - Tools and examples will be updated
  - Section 5.3 ExtractedLicenseInfo licenseName – inconsistency with
    spec – change RDF and tooling to use property licenseName
    (consistent with spec document).
