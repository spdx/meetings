## 2.0 Use Cases

  - 7.X Spdx-lite – Should we specify what fields are needed or
    mandatory?
      - Agree that this is a valid use case
      - Further analysis would be warranted if this use case is
        implemented (e.g. the need for specific fields and the
        difficulty in producing different fields)
  - 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 – updated success scenarios to include side-car case
    and SCM case (discussion on the difference between SCM and side-car
    case). May make a more general case. Existing use cases under 5
    describe the delivery mechanism. Changing language to “delivered in
    all applicable SPDX delivery use cases (5.x)”.
  - Add a note to subsetting use case upstream source that other fields
    may be modified.

## LinuxCon
