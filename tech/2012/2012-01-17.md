## Agenda:

  - Update on tools
  - Discuss proposal for hierarchical supply chain (bug 818)

## Update on tools

  - Discussed using XSLT to produce HTML form an RDF/XML file including
    some of the challenges with order not being guarenteed
  - Jack offered to help with the HTML and .css on the RDF to HTML tools
  - Agreed to add SPDX examples to the git repo (bug 988 assigned to
    Gary)

## Hierarchical supply chain

  - Agreed that UML would be a good way to describe and discuss the
    proposal
  - Ed drafted a class diagram
  - Discussion on the need to discuss more concrete classes vs. modeling
    higher levels of abstraction – agreed that we need to do both
    simultaneously
  - Discussion on relationship between SPDX element and current model,
    will pick up the discussion with more concrete examples
  - Example of a file – proposal would be a URI and Checksum reference
    to a file (under specifier)
  - Referential nodes - are referenced nodes things that must be
    referenced or can be referenced? Proposal that it would be “best if
    referenced”
  - Do referential nodes introduce an unnecessary complexity?
      - This may be required for signing the references.
      - Alternative proposal to signing – archive structure where the
        files are copied
      - Do references need to be resolved for the SPDX specification to
        work? Problem with requiring references to be resolved is the
        SPDX doc could not be read without access to those references.
      - Having a reference model would make it easier for certain use
        cases and scenarios (e.g. packager of a WAR file containing many
        copyrighted elements).
  - Ed will send out the class diagram once complete
  - We will pick up the discussion next week
