## Agenda

  - Discussion on SPDX package definitions
  - Discuss proposal for hierarchical supply chain (bug 818)

## Package definitions

  - Start with Wiki’s definitions
  - Kate proposed any collection of files
  - Jack’s proposal – unit of delivery of software files
      - What is a “unit” of delivery, over time one unit of delivery may
        not be a unit of delivery later in the supply chain
      - Discussion on package/subpackage supply chain model
        (manufacturing analogy)
      - Different between unit of consumption vs. unit of delivery
  - The current RDF Package definition could be used
  - \* Discussion on if a single file could be both a package and not a
    package
  - Agreed on the usefulness of a definition “{} represent a collection
    of one or more files that are delivered as a unit" vs "A package
    represents a collection of software files that are delivered as a
    single functional component" from
    <http://spdx.org/system/files/spdx-rdf-terms_27.html#Package>

<!-- end list -->

  - The “{}” term will be replaced with an agreed upon term (TBD)
  - Follow-up on possibly further defining “delivered as a unit”
