    consistency
  - Discuss proposals on verification code algorithms – review email
    thread from Marshal

Review of the terms “Unknown”, “Undetermined”, and “None”:

Discussion of Undetermined/NotSpecified/NotAnalyzed terminology
proposal. Outcome: recommendations made to revise proposal to reflect 4
use cases where license/copyright/url cannot be specified:

  - 1\) analyzed and data is insufficient to draw a conclusion
  - 2\) analyzed, and conclusion is Not Licensed
  - 3\) analyzed, and no data found
  - 4\) not analyzed
  - Revised proposal sent out to list on 04/19
  - Add “NONE” category for concluded license
  - Change “NOTSPECIFIED” to “NONESEEN”

Discussion of cases where no info is available need to be captured
affirmatively in RDF license valuesor whether empty value is sufficient

  - Conclusion: should be affirmative; provide values that specifically
    address this use case

Discussion of how best to handle special terms: as literals/constants or
try to "shoe horn" into license registry

  - Noted that these terms can be applied to copyright and URL data, not
    just license data
  - Proposal: use URI that points to definition page on
    [spdx.org](http://spdx.org/) but NOT license page
  - All will require special case treatment

Review differences between pdf doc and html rdf spec:

  - For licenses, change the application to match rdf html spec on the
    “NONE” (etc.) being spdx/rdf/terms URI’s. Peter to update
    vocabulary with new terms.
  - Spdx:License class – ok as is for beta; revisit after beta
  - CreatorInfo cardinality – go with the pdf cardinality for now and
    revisit after Beta start
  - Cardinality of licenseInfoFromFile is 1 .. n
  - Cardinality licenseConcluded, … cardinality 1 – if multiple
    licenses, represented as a conjunctive or disjunctive set
  - Cardinality of licenseInfoInFile is 1..n (semantics similar
    licenseInfoFromFiles)
  - Describe which properties of DOAP are used in both the pdf and html
    (name and homepage)
  - Agreed to change licenseID → licenseId in pdf, html, and app
