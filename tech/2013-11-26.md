## Agenda

SPDX 2.0 Updates and discussion Maven proposal for tools Markos Project

## SPDX 2.0

  - Usage Field proposal (see
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/Proposals/2012-02-01/Usage_Relationship_Proposal>)
      - General agreement that usage is part of the relationship
      - Discussion on how the relationships are impacted when nesting
        one SPDX document inside another SPDX document
          - Will any of the relationships be “overridden”?
          - Do we have sufficient mechanisms in the model? Annotation
            can be used.
          - Will consider in the instance diagramming effort
  - Mechanisms for tag/value format in capturing more complex
    relationships in SPDX 2.0
      - Gary did some research and the Turtle RDF format can be made
        readable with sufficient namespace manipulation
      - Gary to produce an SPDX 1.2 example of the Turtle format for
        discussion

## Maven use in SPDX tools

  - Proposal to move to Maven builds for the SPDX tools and remove the
    libraries from the direct distribution
  - Most call participants were neutral to positive on use of Maven
  - Suggestion to look at Artifactory
      - Update: It looks like the Artifactory repository will support
        the Maven POM files to be used in the SPDX Tools

## MarkOS Project

  - The “Market for Open Source” (http://www.markosproject.eu/) has
    published an initial ontology (see
    <http://www.markosproject.eu/downloads/deliverables/>)
  - Bill has been in contact with the organization
  - Suggest that we track progress and perhaps sync up terms
