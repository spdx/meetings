## Agenda

  - Composite Package Requirements
  - Verification Code
  - Basic practices on file naming (to include or not include version)

## Verification Code

  - Discussion on whether we should include a verification code or just
    have an algorithm to calculate the verification code from the data
    within the SPDX document
      - Requirements – determine if a package has been modified – or -
        was this SPDX file generated against the files being looked at
      - Is it simpler to have a verification code than it is to
        calculate?
          - Depends on use case
          - Use Case 1: In comparing an SPDX document to the files, the
            algorithm would need to be executed anyway – would be more
            work to compare to the verification code
          - Use Case 2: In comparing 2 SPDX documents, only need to
            compare verification codes – would be less work
          - Variation on Use Case 2: case where the SPDX file represents
            a binary “blob” and the file level information may be lost
          - Use Case 3: Verification of an SPDX file used in a “side
            car” scenario (where the SPDX file is not included in the
            archive file itself)
          - Can’t think of any other use cases – but leaving open the
            possibility for other use cases
          - Use Case 2 would likely be done in a scenario where Use Case
            1 would also be done (or in a scenario where the SPDX is
            used in a “side-car” scenario)
          - Remove the verification code would cause the SPDX files to
            not be backwards compatible – would need to be a 2.0 change
          - Concern about losing credibility if we throw the field out
            this early
          - Proposal to change the verification code to option for
            backwards compatibility
  - Fixing the algorithms
      - Discussed issues with the locale
      - Discussed proposal to encode in UTF-8 then perform a byte sort
          - Issue with UTF-8 encoding may have some options which differ
            for unusual characters – would result in byte sequence
            differences
          - Even if locale issues were resolved, the encoding issues
            would remain since the hash function is performed on the
            bytes.
          - Proposal to use common utility “iconv” to encode the text
              - Concern about licensing for some tools
              - Concern about acceptance in the Java community
          - No one on the call was comfortable providing a specific
            proposal/resolution
  - Next steps:
      - Fix the algorithm – continue discussion on fixing the algorithm
          - Seek out an expert (or experts) on encoding issues
          - Review section
          - Revisit if the field should be removed, remain mandatory or
            change it as optional
          - Seek out expert on encoding issues
          - For background - review section 7 man page for locale
