## Updates

  - A replacement library for GoLang was contributed by Steve
      - A new repository was created:
        <https://github.com/spdx/tools-golang>
      - The old go library was renamed to ATTIC-go but is still
        available: <https://github.com/spdx/ATTIC-tools-go>
  - Added DCO sign-off to the tools git repo and golang repos
  - We should go through the other repos and see if the contributing
    needs to be updated for a DCO signoff

## SPDX Spec Contribution Process

  - Contributing document was updated with a pull request from Thomas:
    <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/110>
  - Discussion on rebase vs merge
      - Rebase is easier to follow changes
  - Maintaining various development branches
      - Latest deployed version is master
      - Any changes to the latest, a new branch will be made for a
        hotpatch to the master
      - For later branches, we can do rebases to incorporate the
        appropriate changes
      - Need to handle merge conflicts which are likely due to breaking
        changes in the major version
      - Suggest waiting until a release candidate then do a big merge
  - Would like to generate the specification for the in-development
    branches
