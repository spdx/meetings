## 1.2 planning

  - Discussed who would do the updates for the RDF terms – requires Ruby
    knowledge. No one on the call had expertise in Ruby. Gary and/or
    Bill could do the updates if no one else is available.
  - Reviewed 1.2 bugs and status of document
  - Gary sent Bill proposed doc changes for case sensitivity and license
    templates
  - Bug 1121 is partially included in the document update, but the
    license headers will require more thought and discussion. Questions
    on the header include:
      - Are more than one header text allowed per license? If so, how
        would that be represented in the spreadsheet?
      - Are the license headers templatized or straight text?
  - Next steps for 1.2 include updating the text for the 1.2 targeted
    bugs and proposing text changes to the starting point document.
  - Target the 3rd week of August for all spec changes to allow time for
    tooling updates before Linuxcon

## Other Business

  - LinuxCon - Is there
  - 1.2 date – target Linuxcon
