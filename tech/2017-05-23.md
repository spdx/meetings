## License consideration for Github integration project

  - Preferred license for SPDX project is Apache 2.0
  - Some of the scanners Anna would like to use in the git integration
    project use GPL and LGPL licenses
  - GPL 2 may conflict with Apache 2.0
      - Gary and/or Anna will confirm the that the license is GPL 2.0 or
        later
      - If GPL 2.0 or later, we can use GPL 3 which will not conflict
        with the APache license
  - One goal is to have Github pickup some of the open source code
      - GPL may limit usage by Github
      - Agree to try and structure the code so that the Github
        extensions would just use Apache
      - A separate project could be created which combines the scanners
        with the library. This project would use the GPL license.

## SPDX specification to github

  - Thomas is pushing the last changes now – should be available soon
  - Agreed to maintain changes in the master branch and use tagging for
    most recent
  - Thomas can create branches for 2.1 and 2.2 to allow for changes
    concurrent with more radical changes
  - Alexios would like to avoid branches, using tags instead
  - Need to create a contributing doc that describes the branches
  - Thomas will publish a proposed contributing doc
  - Will discuss in 2 weeks

## Next SPDX Spec

  - See
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJqWGU02ynzrJ5CvmX1z2mBssOSpuBvuKene8jVJGNI/edit>
  - Question: Single format or multiple formats supported?
      - Multiple formats would benefit adoption since it appeals to
        different communities
      - Websites could support different formats and use context
        negotiation to view different formats
      - Tools could be used to translate
      - Would need to support the computer language of choice
      - Agree that supporting multiple formats supports higher adoption
  - Discussion on format needing to supported linked data/graphs
      - Complexity could be an inhibitor for adopting linked data
      - Data may need to be linked to be useful
      - Thomas – Proposal for incremental support, non-linked data would
        have less mandatory fields
  - Proposal to make RDF/Turtle preferred RDF representation
      - Next revision, replace RDF/XML with RDF/Turtle
      - Action: Update the github spec with RDF/Turtle examples (replace
        the RDF/XML)
  - We will revisit JSON and YAML once we have Philippe present
      - General agreement using standard parsers such as JSON and YAML
        would be positive for adoption
