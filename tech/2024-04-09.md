## Notes
- Sean opened https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/703 for review.
  - Alexios to review.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/701
  - Generalized the idea that we have a content identifier that describes the content of an artifact.
  - Introduces the identifier property and type, which has type and value. value is string, value is enumeration.
  - We added gitoid for RC2 but this is the generalization.
  - Adds a new property but does not remove the gitoid property from RC2.
  - Adds a way to record a content identifier but nothing is required.
  - Only an addition - not removing anything.
  - This is a general mechanism so type is a string, not IRI.
  - gitoid and swhid are both IRI's, why not restrict to IRI?
    - Suggestion to change type to IRI and broaden to string in the future (non breaking change).
  - Why are we keeping gitoid as a property if we have this generalized approach?
    - Removing gitoid would be a breaking change.
    - Preference on the call to remove the gitoid property as duplication is confusing.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v3.0/docs/annexes
  - Joshua will add a "getting started with SPDX" file he has to the 3.0 annexes.
  - Combine NTIA and BSI/CRA guidance for mapping with SPDX into: "Using SPDX to comply with guidance"
    - Karsten going to add BSI once Rose is finished with NTIA.

- Alexios will add PR to add "serialization" chapter/annex (undecided, TBD where to put)

- Redirect URLs are broken with spec parser file name changes, need to update
  - Official URLs are re-directing to GitHub. The issue is the file names changed from the output of the spec parse, so the re-directs are pointing at the wrong files now.
  - mkdocs.yml not being updated in the spec repo.
    - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0/mkdocs.yml
    - Should this be updated by the output of the spec parser when we create new classes and properties?
    - If there's a way to have something in the repo to directory walk the model and auto-populate that is the most fool-proof.
      - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0/.github/workflows/publish_v3.yml should be updated.
      - Rose opened https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/902 to track.
    - Jeff L on call:
      - Do we have a canonical way of determining that list (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0/mkdocs.yml) currently?
      - We don't care to exclude or specifically include files.
      - Whatever the spec parser spits out we should include all of them.
      - Shouldn't be too difficult to do for the model directory files.

- https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/107
  - It forces the subject of any element to be an IRI, not a blank node.
  - Creates an IRI only for element? Shouldn't this also apply to all classes inheriting from element?
  - Alexios will review.
  - Two different places to do predicate - on the property and on element itself

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/74
  - This conversion document should become an annex.
  - May already exist
    - In https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0/docs/annexes/diffs-from-previous-editions.md ?
    - Need confirmation from Kate/Gary.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/351
  - do we support inline Markdown? On the web, yes.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/418
  - Can we push this to 3.1? Consensus that we will push to 3.1.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/702
  - This is not consistent when Sean was updating the model diagram.
  - At core of software level they have max count but no min count,
    at the AI level they have min count but no max count -- not consistent.
  - It will be correct on the generated file but on the Markdown may be
    confusing with inconsistencies.
  - Alexios prefers to not have extra information but is agreeable to the PR.
    - Rose merged.

- Where are code examples going?
  - Nisha working on go bindings - where should she put it?
    - Planning for it to be a separate go package.
    - Discussing with @puerco how to integrate it into the spdx-tools-golang repo.
    - A separate module would be the easiest way to integrate it.
  - Python bindings from Joshua are ready for Friday release
    - Have not been published to PyPI or anything.
  - Should be published as PyPI package, versioned and released.
  - Should be clear that this is low level integration and has no convenience
    layers at all like the Python tools.
    - This will not be done by 3.0 but that's ok.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/901
  - This needs to be reviewed/merged (by Jeff L) with failure
    and then URLs re-directed (Joshua emailed Gary to fix).

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/434
  - Would be a fairly substantive change.
  - Probably don't want to do for 3.0, but if we do this later it would be
    a breaking change (means we would need to save for 4.0, not 3.1).
  - Likely not going to be able to do this in a few days. Group agrees.

- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/465
  - Is this still valid?
  - No domains included in generated ontology right now - this has already been addressed.
