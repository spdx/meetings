  - Kate's grammar for the 'tag-value' format / DEB-5
  - Gary's slides for tools to be made available
  - recap / status of inclusion of new license fields
  - Proposal process

## Grammar Tag-Value / DEB-5

  - Is there a difference between the grammar embedded and the proposed
    grammar?
  - Similar. Purpose of Kate's proposal is to resolve ambiguities.
  - Difference in syntax of the grammar
  - DEB-5 compatibility would require a different grammar

## representation

  - Concern about forward compatibility - ability of a version X parser
    to understand version X+N documents
  - There is a goal to be compatible with the DEB-5 which would lead
    more to the DEB-5 based grammar
  - Need a way to map between the RDF and tag value and between tag
    value and RDF

## Gary's slides for tools to be made available

  - Can the pretty printer output tag-value
  - Concern about not having a formal parser for the tag-value - could
    lead to bugs if hand-coded emitter for the tag-value
  - Gary agreed to prototype a tag-value emitter
  - Gary will ping Kate for the current Spreadsheet format
  - For contribution/feedback switch from emailing spdx.org to use
    bugzilla
  - Mention that in the spec there will be a grammar and an RDF OWL
    document

## recap / status of inclusion of new license fields

  - An asserted license field seems to have achieved consensus
  - Proposal to split the license field into asserted license,
    "detected" or "seen" license, and a comment field
  - Will continue the proposal process on the spdx-tech mailing list and
    in bugzilla
