      - Have not heard back on the license list
      - Updating license list version to 1.19
  - Schedule – tech team review this week followed by a broader review
    next week
  - Process: One reviewer/editor at a time. The document will be passed
    on to the next reviewer/editor. Only one day per reviewer/editor.
    Word document will be passed. This should avoid the merge problem.
    Jack and Bill will be reviewer/editors followed by Gary.
