## zLib example discussion

Discussion on the whether the SPDX Doc is necessary. Led to a discussion
on having the SPDX Doc contain multiple packages which led to a
discussion whether we were constraining the model to a flat model.
Decided to table the discussion for version 2.

Discussion on the file being associated to a package - Section 5.5 -
need to have a property to associate the file with the package. Needed
to have the RDF parse properly and to have the graph represent the file
relationships properly

Discussion on non-standard licenses - should it be within the package or
at the SPDX Doc level.

Three possibilities - "describes license" creates a separate license
resource not associated with the SPDX doc or package; a property of the
SPDX doc; property of the package

Discussed the pro's and cons of different approaches. Technically, all
three approaches are similar in that the non-standard license will only
be valid within the specific SPDX doc (and there is only one package per
SPDX doc). Several people felt that the non-standard license should be
associated with the analysis - perhaps leading to it being associated
with the SPDX doc.

## Actions

  - Gary to writeup a proposal for hasFile belonging to a package
    (section 5.5)
  - Peter to write up the alternatives for the non-standard licenses
  - Kate to write up a proposal for field to be added for the validation
    of entire package
