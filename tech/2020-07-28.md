## SPDX 3.0 Base Profile

  - Continuing discussion from last week on the model
  - relationship Model as it relates to container
      - There will be a large number of external references
      - Potential issue of sharability across different deployment
      - Keep the SBOM with the artifact – so there will be a lot of
        external document references
  - Snippets simplification proposal
      - Do we relax the guiding principles for using external
        definitions (e.g. pointer model)?
          - Proposal to relax guiding principle to review existing
            standards but only adopt those that do not overly complicate
            the SPDX standard
  - Overview of Template for profiles
      - Discussion on how we represent the mandatory/optional
        requirements
      - Only change for an existing field is to make the field mandatory
  - Should we allow any arbitrary additional tools?
      - Allows for easy extension
      - Most tools will ignore what they don’t understand
      - Possible issue with allowing proprietary extensions which may
        not be helpful to the open standard
      - Validation may break
      - Different design principle from 2.0 where extensions are only in
        annotations and comments
      - Proposal to allow adding new profiles and new fields in point
        release
          - General agreement
      - Appendix should be added to describe how the fields should be
        added
  - Model update – replaced string field of PackageName with “FromFile”
      - General agreement the update made sense – but is different from
        2.0
      - Agreed on a different name – packageFile
      - Checksum would be in the file and can be removed from the
        Package as a property
  - Relationship model for containers (continued)
      - Do we support the decomposition of SBOM’s as described by Nisha
          - General agreement and support
          - Suggestion to add external reference location information to
            find the external documents

## Next Week

  - Continue discussion on container SBOM relationships
  - Aug 11 Legal profile
