## Notes

- TEA Protocol presentation postponed
- Gary recap changes in the model https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
- We still have an issue with the CI. Currently shacl2code failed the CI because the way we had changed about abstract class: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1160
  - This PR should fix that issue: https://github.com/JPEWdev/shacl2code/pull/32
- New diagrams update (merged): https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1159
  - On the website now: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/annexes/rdf-model/
- Build: "LogReference" https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/919
  - The meeting agrees that the "LogReference" is a standardized string for the purpose that parser/consumer will know the type of information at the urlScheme target. The description can be improved in the next version (3.1) but it is fine for now.
- Diagrams:
  - Sean: with new diagrams we missed a lot of information
  - Sean: Having all enums in one page will help reader understand
  - Sean: Having the IndividualElement class in the diagrams is important as it is an integrity issue; the model and the spec should match
  - At the very least in 3.0.1 we should have IndividualElement
  - Art: RelationshipType box that provides information about from and to Elements can be back in 3.1
  - Sean will make a PR to update diagram to add IndividualElement
- Decision - release 3.0.1 pending the following:
    - Update to a new shacl2code version that fixes the SPDX spec CI
    - Merge in changelog PR #938
    - Merge in the update to the diagram to include Core/IndividualElement - Sean to produce the PR
- branch/tag -> publication target URL mapping
  - Should release tag be mutable? The meeting has consensus that the release tag should not be mutable. Unless it will bring surprise.
  - Issue tracking the release / tag / publication mapping: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1155
