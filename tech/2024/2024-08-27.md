### 3.0.1 fixes
- Model #852 - Update diagrams for v3.0.1: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/852
  - Feel it's better than what's there,  looking of Sean to take one more pass on merged version, 
- Spec #1091 Fix typos in Build and Lite Profiles Conformance - already merged
- Spec #1090 Since the namespace mapping mentioned in that paragraph is not implemented yet,
    may be hold off until it is implemented.
- Spec #1087
  - JSON-LD, agreed to use "Linking Data"
  - PURL, agreed that the L is "Locator" however, we may want to consider "Uniform Resource Locator" in the future.
- Spec #1063 Add RDF IRIs etc to Serialization section - Not merge. Leave those info inside the spdx-3-model  repo

### Schema generation

- Current schema for 3.0.1 draft - not where expected.
  It is at https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/gh-pages/v3.0.1-draft/model/schema.json
  Also at https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1-draft/model/schema.json
- If anyone needs a draft version of the schema - use the above link.  IMPORTANT NOTE: the context URL in the schema is not live.  
- Once live, the schema will be published at https://spdx.org/sh.. [gary to fill in]
- Tooling generation - trying to get things matching effectively.
- ? github action changes? 

### Branching Renames
- We will wait until the 3.0.1 is released.
- Need to have it documented what's going where, and next steps.
  Art has a draft started at: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/857
- CI for new branch structure will need to be updated as well 
- Need to decide how we should be handling the contributing.MD file (in 2 or 1 repos)
- We need a written document of mapping of branches/tags/directory names.
- We need to update README & CONTRIBUTING.
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1093 will remain in Draft state - until after 3.0.1 is released, and will be used to track all the changes.   Will request Japanese team to do review. 

### Visualizing Examples
- Ilan is having trouble loading them.   Gary working on doing the translation from 2.3 to 3.0.1
- Joshua notes that 3.0.1 will not be available until after 3.0.1 is published, so for now it's 3.0
