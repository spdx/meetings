## Notes

### Dot Tool
- Dot - ilans requesting adding to tools;   best to link to dots instance.   Gary will work with ilans to get it integrated.   
- Kate asked about exporting drawn example - need to do save from SPDXdoc node to do export. 

### OMG Submission
- Need to freeze model - set of pull requests articulated.   After model is frozen, we'll then freeze specification. 
- Merged the pull request to do the new draft. 
- Reworking branch strategy will be pushed to next week.

### Number of elements in SBOMs (0 or at least 1 ?)
- Lite requires at least 1
- This can be a breaking change. We should check examples and tools.
  - Related, in example: Should the SPDX V3 sbom contain a list of elements?
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1013
- For SBOM - should have minimum one element, and one root for an SBOM.   To align with SPDX lite.
External properties:
    - /Software/Sbom/element        mincount  1       
    - /Software/Sbom/rootElement       mincount 1.
- Alexios will create a PR for this, reference #1013, and we'll ask Joshua to review, and comment on impact of his tools.

### Change URIs to 3.0.1
- Propose change: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/800
- Discussion from 2024-07-16 and follow up: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/996
- Need migration guide and matching guide between 3.0.0 and 3.0.1?   Yes, after tagging will be generated.
- We may need to have owl:sameAs to equate 3.0 and 3.0.1 elements.
  - The RDF parser needs a reasoner for this.
  - Discussed on the call,  update PR.   Recommend that owl:sameAs by Arthit & Gary be added to the Spec parser.   Want to avoid breaking some ecosystems.    This is mostly specific to RDF serializations.   For instance HASKALL RDF doesn't have owl support. 
  
### Do we want to change links to the HTML from the model github repo?
 - Propose change:  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/796
 - Agreed we would point to HTML for supporting ISO
 
 ### Add Text labels to bare URLs
 - agreed, and merged https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/810
 
 ### SLSA terms changed
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/808
- Align with the updated term changes - agreed to merge. 
- Nisha to do follow up investigation with SLSA to verify the definitions haven't changed, and will put in a follow up PR if needed. 

### "FIXME" to be resolved in JSON-LD Serialization doc
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/802#discussion_r1687190480
- Gary has question for Rose.
- Alexios recommends postponing discussion, as it doesn't impact generated spec.

### AI and Data: Shorten AI and Data profile summaries in README
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/743 -- Approved in 2024-07-24 AI meeting
- Just impacts the README, so not showing up in spec,  skipping.

### Correct Annex list
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/992 
  - Discussed 2024-07-16 Tech call. One approval.
  - Postponing this one, and a new version will be generated, as it's already stale. 

### Update License Expression annex
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/993
  - Gary resolved conflicts with Alexios.   Agreed in the call that this should go to "using" rather than going into the spec directly. 
  - Decided to close this, and put the PR against USING branch. 
  - Alexios copied over to "using" 

### What typographic device to use instead of ~~strikethrough~~ for REMOVED in spec?
 - we'll remove strikethroughs as it may not allowed in standard doc
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/997
  - closing this PR;  since we don't want to enable PRs. 
  
  ### https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/813
  - Update Gitoid URL to include specific release (rather than main) so content does not change
  - Alexios will add in separate PR to handle the SWHID to include ISO numbers.
