## Discussion on Spec Parser
* Need to pick up the discussion with Alexios
* Need to decide if we're going to commit to the new branch for RC2
* Jeff and Gary volunteered to help if it makes sense
* Gary will follow-up on an email thread with Alexios and Jeff

## RC2 issues and pull requests
* Integrity method - agree to pick this up in the next security call, Gary will follow-up with Jeff
* Nisha brought up the consideration of repositories - e.g. Git
* Kate wanted to make sure we included use cases beyond security, e.g. legal and operations
* Extension namespace - issue raised was the same layer issue we have with Core referencing properties with a range that is not in the Core namespace - this will be discussed in the related licensing issue
* For extension, once the spec parser is fixed, we'll merge it - if we make a layered decision different, then we'll create a separte pull request
* Rules for referencing non-core classes and properties - we did discuss on a previous call several months ago and decided that properties need to be in core for validation reasons - we should revisit this to make sure we're not "painting ourself into a corner"
* LicenseListVersion type - see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/529#issuecomment-1874353239
* Cardinality of Core/Annotation/contentType - resolved - see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/565#issuecomment-1874368343
* Request for a volunteer to document the MediaType relationship to Statement within Annotation - Nisha agreed to take that on

## Modular vs single SBOMs
* Agreed on the need for a blog post
* Kate will create a google doc
* Email thread started with Victor, Gary, Kate, and Bob - anyone else interested, please email one of us and we'll add you to the thread
* Meeting set for Friday at 11AM Eastern to discuss - anyone intersted, please email gary@sourceauditor.com and I'll send you an invite

## Decisions
* Go with SemVer for license list version with a migration plan for migrating prior versions
* Cardinality of Core/Annotation/contentType - will be 0..1

## Future agenda topics
* Use of the JSON model format: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/579
* Rules for referencing non-core classes and properties: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/583
