## Notes

### Specification
- Goal is aiming towards getting the .pdf to match with the generated version from the website.
- We need to finalize the structure of the whole specification.     Proposed ToC needs to be found
- Went through proposed TOC and outline of document that Bob has put together.
- The "diff with previous version" annex should compare against the previous ISO version, which is v2.2.1.
- List the order of the profiles, the same order as in the scope section.
- When will the PRs for the new content land?   Started landing now and new content to go in the rest this week.
- Ask Bob to update the milestones with the OMG related dates for 3.0.1.
  - The Q3 OMG meeting is on 10-12 Sep 2024.
- Q: What is the conformance section?  See 2.2.1 for example, and Alexios has prepared.

### Tools emerging - Dots
- Ilan's tool - Link to “dots”: http://151.145.81.233/ for folks to try it out.
- The tool can import from and export to JSON-LD files
- Not yet support ExternalMap
- Once ready, put this to the SPDX tools page

### Tools emerging - Lice Comb
- Peter working on library that is using Gary's tools.
- "Lice Comb"
  - lice(nse)
- Maven POM (package metadata) has license information but in free-form text. The tool use NLP/complex regex to convert free-form text license info from POMs (on Maven Central and Clojure) to SPDX License identifiers.
  - Find 200+500 unique license names
  - Find wild names in free-form, including "TODO" and JavaScript code inside the license info
- tools-license - command line tool that interacts with licecomb -->  cljr-spdx --> spdx java tools
- The tool can parse a string and return a list of license IDs (can be useful for programmatic comparison)
  - For example:
    - "Apache-2.0" --> {:license-id "Apache-2.0"}
    - "Apache-2.0 OR MIT" --> [:or {:license-id "Apache-2.0"} {:license-id "MIT"}]
    - "MIT OR Apache-2.0" --> [:or {:license-id "Apache-2.0"} {:license-id "MIT"}]
    - "Apache-2.0 or Apache-2.0" --> {:license-id "Apache-2.0"}
    - "Apache" --> {:license-id "Apache-2.0"}
    - "Apache Software License" --> {:license-id "Apache-2.0"}
    - "Apache Software License version 1.0" --> {:license-id "Apache-1.0"}
  - Note that these are the tool's interpretation, it may not aligned with legal or SPDX standpoint
    (if reordering is equal, or should "GPL" bes"GPL-3.0-only" or "GPL-1.0", etc).
  - Proprietary license support through "LicenseRef-lice-comb-xxx" IDs
- The tool can fetch license information from Maven Central, if exists, and return SPDX IDs
- The tool can display a traceback on how it arrived with a concluded license
