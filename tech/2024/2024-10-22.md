### CISA SBOM Generation Container results for SPDX

- CISA Tiger team on SBOM generation.  2 hours before this one.
  - now generating SPDX; but tools generating SPDX aren't doing a good job (look at "SBOM quality").
    https://github.com/CISA-SBOM-Community/SBOM-Generation/actions/runs/11348338576
  - looking for help with analysis and putting in issues to the tools.
  - ilans willing to help out.
- Anyone else using the Interlynk tool? https://www.interlynk.io/
  - Not much, probably issues in the quality tool itself.
- It's being called a "Quality Score"
- Not finding things for licensing, checksums, document license, licensing...
- Probably related to issues to Trivy & Parlay as first tools.
  - https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy - Find vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc in SBOM
  - https://github.com/snyk/parlay - Enrich SBOMs with data from third party services
    - Parlay doesn't support SPDX 3 yet
- Where the score comes from?
  - discussion of Application - has NONE for all licenses.  Problem on generation side?  Yes.  CycloneDX & SPDX seeing same result.

### Translation of SPDX 3.0 specification

- Checking if the structure of translation files are as agreed
  - https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/main/tech/2024/2024-05-28.md
  - https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/main/tech/2024/2024-06-06-translation.md
  - "ja" vs "jp" inconsistencies (ISO 639-1 language code uses "ja")
- Japanese translation as a work in progress for the Open Source Summit Japan 28-29 Oct
  See:
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/898
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1141
- Chinese translations are also in progress, targetting the end of the month. 

### AI BOM white paper
- Kate showed team current draft, in last stages of review.
- Expecting it to be published shortly.

### Spec parser pending PR
- URI of SPDX-invalid, looks weird downstream.
- Discussion: AbstractClass is prefixed with <http://spdx.invalid./>
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1089
- A PR to use equivalentClass instead of AbstractClass
  https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/158
- The meeting in general like the approach and see the benefits but agreed to discuss more with Alexios

### Next week
- Follow up on the AbstractClass approach next week.
