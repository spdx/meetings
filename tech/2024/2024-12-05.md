# SPDX Tech Team Meeting Individual Creation Infos Discussion 2024-12-05

## Attendees
- Alexios Zavras
- Bob Martin
- Gary O'Neall
- Ilan Schifer
- Sean Barnum
- Arthit Suriyawongkul

## Agenda
- Resolve if we should have one creation info shared across all individuals defined by SPDX or if each individual should have its own creation info

## Notes
- On the call we all agreed that license individuals are only represented as serialized JSON-LD - so they can follow the serialization spec and do not need to have separate URI defined creation infos
- There was some concerns expressed that the separate individual creation infos would not look naturual for document level SPDX exchanges
- We did agree to have separate creation infos for each of the individuals defined in the spec
- Alexios created a pull request which we will merge: https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/159
- Sean propsed adding additional documentation on the IDs for non-element classes
- There was not consensus on the additional documentation
- We agreed to discuss additional documentation in a future release of the spec
- Added an issue to track: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/934

### Original compromise proposal from Sean

So, I am working to carve out time to writeup explanatory rationale on this issue that is not too simple (the overall scope of the issue is fairly complex) and not too complicated.
I realized after my below reply to Alexios’ email that maybe there is quicker compromise solution that avoids us spending any more time going down already well-worn rabbit holes.
 
I believe the sticking point for you is that you do not want to define separate unique CreationInfo instances for each Individual in the formal (RDFS/OWL/SHACL) specification.
It sounds like maybe there is not significant argument against the hard fought consensus we reached a while back on the necessary independence of non-Element class instances in deserialized SPDX content.
If I am incorrect about that and people are arguing against the consensus then we are likely at an impasse (I consider this a critical issue hence all the effort put into the discussion and debate back then) or need further re-discussion and re-debate to get back to that consensus.
 
If I am correct then I would propose that the easiest and fastest solution would involve four parts:
Consider any publication of the SPDX formal (RDFS/OWL/SHACL) spec as a serialized document (with the constraint that all Individuals with shared CreationInfo would need to be in the SAME serialized document) where multiple Individuals could ”share” the same CreationInfo instance using a unique id
Add the yellow highlighted content into .md spec files for ALL non-Element classes
Add the following at the end of the Description section of the .md spec files for ALL non-Element classes
“Deserialized SPDX content MUST have a separate instance of this class (with a globally unique identifier) for each separate element referencing it. The same instance of this class may NOT be referenced (“shared”) by multiple Elements.”
I realized that the yellow part alone could be ambiguous to some readers on the need for separate instances for each Element.
Add the id property back into the non-Element classed in the diagrams
 
 
I am willing to compromise on #1 and accept this course of action to move us forward quickly.

### Follow-up email from Sean on the issues with single CreationInfo

[sorry about the bad formatting - please feel free to clean this up as a PR to the minutes if you have time]

If my previous proposal of a quick compromise solution is not acceptable, here is a stab at a simple explanation of some of the issues at play. 
A full discussion of all the graph integrity issues and risks is much more involved and complicated than this.
 
I am hoping we can all agree to the proposed compromise course of action and avoid churning through all of this.
 
 
 
Fundamentals of Element classes and non-Element classes
 
Elements are the relevant atomic units of content in an SPDX domain graph
This means all nodes in the graph are Elements and all edges in the graph are ObjectProperties whose type is an Element.
Non-Element classes, literals, etc. may exist in the more granular RDF graph but are rolled up into their associated Element in the SPDX domain graph (similar to a named property graph)
Non-Element class instances are ALWAYS associated with a single Element instance in a deserialized graph
Think of the non-Element object as a “part-of” the associated Element object (like my right arm is a part of me)
If an Element object is added to a graph all of its associated non-Element objects should also be added
If an Element object is removed from a graph all of its associated non-Element objects should also be removed (don’t leave severed arms laying around ;-))
Non-Element objects should never exist in an SPDX domain graph without an associated Element
In deserialized form ALL Element and non-Element classes have globally unique URI identifiers
In serialized form 
All Elements objects have globally unique URI identifiers and 
non-Element objects have an identifier that is a globally unique URI identifier, a locally unique string identifier, or not present at all if the instance of this class is embedded (e.g., blank node) within the instance of an Element class it is characterizing
non-Element objects may be associated to multiple Element objects
Officially published Individuals should follow the same fundamentals/rules 1-4 above as any other instance content
Information model specifications of individuals are typically considered deserialized but given the split form of the SPDX specification with a textual specification and a formal (RDFS/OWL/SHACL) specification autogenerated from the textual specification, it would be valid to consider the textual specification as deserialized and a particular serialized (JSON-LD, Turtle, etc.) publication of the formal specification as a serialized form.
 
 
Why are fundamentals 2-4 above important and multiple Elements not allowed to associate to a single non-Element?
 
If looking to define a single set of creationinfo once and reference it from multiple Elements:
 
Simple case where everything in a graph has the same creationinfo looks easy
Real-world variation gets more complicated
For producers
When creating SPDX content the creator must look at the creationinfo desired for each Element and not simply express it but must keep track of ALL creationinfo variations being created thus far and must compare the desired property values to all the variations to decide IF a matching variation exists yet, Create a new one if it does not and then enter the appropriate ID in the Element creationInfo
This is a significant amount of additional processing required for all producers rather than simply creating a new creationinfo for each new Element
For consumers
Must remember that content is also not only in a single serialized document. It can exist within one or multiple graphs and include a variety of graph operations (addition, aggregation, filtering, redaction,splitting, querying, deletion, etc.) for a variety of purposes (aggregation, analysis, reuse, etc)
This leads to potential complexity/confusion as multiple (many) instances of exact same creationinfo may exist from different source content yet not at an atomic level to each Element
Managing/maintaining the graph becomes very tricky
Graph is not only purely additive
Content will also be filtered or deleted from a graph (e.g., remove from a datastore, exchange of only a portion of the graph, extract a sub-graph via query, divide a graph into multiple sub-graphs, etc.)
One simple scenario to illustrate
Graph contains 3 Elements with same creationinfo
1 of the Elements is deleted
Normally for a property graph approach deleting the Element itself would include deleting all non-Element aspects of the object. If you don’t do this you run the risk of leftover junk cluttering the graph and the graph not conforming to SPDX
With a non-independent approach (single creationinfo referenced by multiple Elements) you would first have to query the entire graph to determine if there are any other Elements other than the one being deleted that are using the creationinfo. If yes then it must stay otherwise it should be deleted to avoid orphans.
This must be done for ALL deletions always involving significant additional logic required by ALL adopters (not provided by graph db) and significant additional querying overhead
The above is one of many problematic scenarios when the full scope of ecosystem graph operations is considered. That full scope is beyond the time available to rediscuss here.
Simply expressing CreationInfo independently and directly for all Elements avoids any additional processing logic or query complexity
If compaction to “shared” instances of creationinfo is desired in serialization where the scope of the graph is explicitly known and controlled it can be done as part of serialization, potentially using a single shared/published implementation to provide desired the effect losslessly, without additional complexity and with full integrity.
This would also then require some sort of expansion skolemization implementation (to create unique ids and separate unique instances) to reverse the compaction and create separate unique creationinfo instances for each Element in the deserialized graph.
This issue is closely related to the issue of using blank nodes that was also discussed at length and leading to a consensus that blank nodes could be used within a single serialized document but must be skolemized to globally unique ids upon deserialization. I am intentionally avoiding going down that rabbit hole and attempting to reexplain those issues here.
