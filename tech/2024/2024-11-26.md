## Notes

- Due to the recent updates of cardinality, diagrams need to be updated accordingly to match
    - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/930 opened; Alexios to submit new diagrams before next week
- TEA and MUD API/frameworks. We should make sure that SPDX is supported in those API/frameworks

## Future Agenda Topics
- Suggest the following (in order):
    - TEA and MUD - Accessing SBOM data over the network - Gary
    - AI / Dataset profiles
    - Hardware profile
    - Operations Profile - Kate
    - Cryptographic Algorithms List - Alexios
    - Services Profile - Gary
    - Safety Profile / FUSA
    - Others?

## Adds generation of creationInfo for all Individuals
- two implementations: https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/159 and https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser/pull/154
- Discussion on whether the URIs for the individuals need to be different for each version
  - Agreement that this can be resolved in the 3.1 release - not needed for 3.0.1
- Discussed having named blank nodes in the SHACL/OWL file vs just blank nodes
- Discussed the current restriction of creation info being only blank nodes
   - Agreed we can relax this restriction
   - Concensus Decisions: All non-elements can be either blank nodes OR URI nodes - including creation info
- Concensus Decisions: in the RDF published by the spec, the creationInfo for Individuals will have be a URI node
- Discussion on the license list individuals
   - General agreement that it will also be URI nodes
   - Deferred actual implementation to a separate discussion
- Discussion on whether each individual should have a separate creationInfo
  - Did not come to a conclusion - many on the call did not understand the reason for having separate creation infos
  - Sean will write up the reasons for having separate creation infos for each individual and we'll decide next week
- Discussed alternative where we don't require creation info for the named individuals
  - Concerns expressed about the approach in matching the model and the current validations

## Pushed for next week
- Decision on separate creation infos for each named individual
- URI's for listed licenses: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/886
