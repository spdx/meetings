## Agenda

### Spec 3.0.1
- clear up annex list https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/992
  - We have moved the information documents to a "using" repo
  - This PR renames, re-orders and updates the mkdocs list for the website
  - Annex list content was agreed upon in a previous call 
- publish current? (related: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/934; https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/950)
  - Changes numbers/alias in GitHub workflow and mkdocs.yml
  - We decided we should not put the micro context in the version. Re-direct
  - Discussion if we like to use 3.0.1 (three levels) or 3.0 (two levels). Decided to keep 3.0.1.
  - In ontology/model, the IRI's include the 3.0.0 - will it stay that way? 
    - We need to remove the microversion from SPDXIDs in the ontologies or say they are different things
    - Patch levels must not have breaking changes.
    - Editorial changes (typos, etc.) should be allowed at patch level.
    - If it's a new ontology, it should have a new version number
    - Current proposal is to use the 3 number scheme (ie. 3.0.0)
    - The current 3.0.0 will continue to remain 3.0.0. 3.0.1 , once published, will be distinct
  - PR #950 is ready to merge now
- Update license expression syntax references to license list
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/985 -- changes requested
  - This PR was copied from 2.3 so some references are incorrect
- Add clarification for case-sensitivity for LicenseRef-
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/984 -- changes requested
  - Proposed new wording

### Model 3.0.1
- Fix wrong range in "low" entry of CvssSeverityType
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/793
  - PR needs to remove the re-formatting otherwise looks good - Done
- publishedTime redefined in EpssVulnAssessmentRelationship
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/795 - Ready to merge
  - Change here is at a documentation level - publishedTime is and will be there in the model before and after the change.
- Remove unnecessary restrictions
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/797 - The meeting agrees with change. Ready to merge

## Notes

- Discussion about external properties restrictions and how to best express that inside SHACL
