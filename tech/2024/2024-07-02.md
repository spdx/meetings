## Notes

- Working through moving Annexes to their own document for "How To"
   - Alexios has created first pull request that has copied over the files.
   - This is a direct copy to move the content over.
   - Lite model is already in the spec right now.
     Profile conformance is already there, and will be eventually translated into
     code in machine-readable format.
   - All definitions should be in spdx-3-model/.../Lite/Lite.md
   - How to use should be in the new "How to use" document.
- Ito, Ninjouji:
- SPDX 3.0 specification is very huge
- Select one of the profiles - cormant with ISO standard.
- Propomoted that the industrial use case is in the standard.
- Prefer to declare that the minimum definition of the profile in the ISO standard.
  So it is easy for manufacturer to declare ISO compliance is met. 
- The current Lite definition in the model, doesn't give sufficient information
  for the manufacturers to understand if they comply or not.
- Challenge is expanding information about actual objects/instances.
- Profile Conformance is just about the cardinality of properties.
- To be useful - you need to do other parts.  Which fields and what the cardinality.
- Inheritance of classess, so we should be able to articulate this explicit in a document.
- Ask: how can we make SPDX v3, simple to show to people with a mininimum valid set.
- Tak: Lite is looking for Open Source / Security minimum conformance.
  How the cardinality is different from core model to lite profile.
  If cardinality differs, it should be written down.
  Challenge is industries like Automotive, Energy, ... need to see clearly scoped
  set of elements clearly - aconformance for SBOM.
  To immediately know if something is in or out of that scoped set?
  Challenge is how to developers/users be able to find the information.
- To check the conformance with profiles - criteria needs to be more easily
  digestable than this modular format.
- View point is: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuGv1L3H_-Iq6dmH7DnjDgAa90LCRnoHB3DTfuWh0Jg/edit?gid=1718786392#gid=1718786392
- Decision on https://github.com/spdx/using/pull/1 - copy everything over except Lite.
- Next call: Progress on Tooling - Ilans
