## Notes
- Adding links to SPDX 2.x equivalent properties:
- Java (and other) tools can read 2.x and convert to 3.x; need machine-readable mapping between URI properties
- RDF: sameAs should make this "automatic" for RDF users
- sameAs can have 2-way meaning, which may be cause issues (can mix 3.x into 2.x)
- consensus seems to be this would be more harmful than good
- Suggestions:
- have annex in 3.x spec
- add to markdown and generate some file (JSON) in spec parser
- hand-maintain JSON
- License matching as an annex -- looks good, needs 2nd approval
- Package URL spec annex
- Defined here so spec does not reference a live GitHub repo
- ECMA standard in process, need to update if/when this happens but can move forward for now
- Reviewed PR 779 -- looks good, merged
- Reviewed PR 946 -- Gary approved
- Reviewed PR 1 in spdx/using for adding informative annexes
- examples here?
- demonstrative and normative should be in spec
- Breifly looked at open PRs
- ASK: please get additional reviewers

## Decisions
- Add JSON for 2.x -> 3.x mapping in spec repo

## Action Items
- Gary to add JSON for 2.x -> 3.x mapping in spec repo
- Joshua to review PR 946
