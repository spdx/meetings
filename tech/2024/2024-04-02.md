## Agenda
- Examples of SPDX for tool vendors to implement
- Review outstanding model issues and pull requests
  - Need resolution on
     https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/482 &
     https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/679
     (Joshua, Alexios, Sean, Jeff, Gary?)
  - Add indicator of completeness
    (resolution for https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/629)
    see as resolution, so documentation update.
    Confirm with others.
    Will resolve: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/527
- How to specify algortithm for PVC (ie. SHA1, SHA256, etc.) to interpret the string.
  - I think we need to extend PVC class to have algorithm explicitly
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/646. (see PR for resolution) - Yes.
  - Create Pull request for interpretation of copyright text
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/655 - PR created & reviewed.
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/518 - Can we get a plan to resolve. - Yes

## Notes

### URLs and Examples
- Need examples of SPDX 3 JSON code

- (Joshua Watt) Users must have the capacity to write valid serialized
  SPDX 3 documents on the day of SPDX 3 announcement.
  - In order for JSON-LD serialization to work properly, we need to provide
    URLs for the JSON-LD context file, the JSON schema to validate
    documents, and the RDF model. Currently hosted:
    https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/ .
  - This URL will be encoded into serialized documents, so before we tell
    the masses that they should write SPDX 3 documents, these URLs
    need to be finalized and host actual content.
  - I suspect that we will not want these URLs to live on GitHub, and
    some URL on spdx.dev would be a better choice, but I do not know
    what that URL would be or how to make it "live".
  - I think that making the actual URLs redirect to the GitHub ones will be
    sufficient until we are done finalizing SPDX 3.0, as that might be easier
    than trying to have the current GitHub Actions pipeline publish
    somewhere else, but I have no idea how to set this up.
  - This issue is captured in https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/679,
    please comment there if possible.
  - The two items we need to solve are:
    1. What are the file URLs for these items
    2. Who is going to do the work to setup the redirects

- See pull request for examples in playground - bindings, but not code using bindings.
  - Joshua will have this by end of week in code base.
  - Gary will merge pull request.
  - Lite profile is pending, and can stay pending for 3.0.
- Examples Repo can't be populated until we have the URLs established.
  If we know what the URLs are going to be, we can put them, in, but we
  can't validate until the URLs are populated. Bindings will need to be
  pointed to the URLs. Then when redirection is in place, we can validate
  the documents. 
- Joshua would like to set up CI to automatically validate all the example.
- Proposal is use spdx.org for URLs - if in subdirect of RDF or licenses.
  - Linux Foundation will be needed for subfolder.
  - For context file put in subfolder.
  - For JSON schema, YAML schema.
  - Gary & Steve will need permission (like RDF & License subdirectory).
  - The following paths were agreed on:
    - https://spdx.org/schema/3.0.0/spdx-json-schema.json
    - https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-model.ttl
    - https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld
    - https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-json-serialize-annotations.ttl
  - Joshua notes we need 2 TTL files as well. Extra information to generation in bindings.
  - Can this be hard coded in SHACL2TTL? - Not preferred, rather have as parameter file.
  - 2 TTL files need to be labeled with SPDX and Serialization in the name.

### Go support
- Nisha raised that Go code still needs to be supported. Bindings need to be written.
- Joshua doesn't have experience but would welcome input.
- Nisha has volunteered to take a first pass, similar to Pythons.
- Adolfo volunteered to help.
 
### Namespaces
- Discussion between Gary, Joshua, Jeff, Alexios, Bob, Max landed around
  having property, but structure so we can refine it in 3.1 in future in a non-breaking way.
- Proposal is to rename it as "PrefixMap" to "NamespaceMapClass" has PrefixMap
- Alexios ok changing Map into PrefixMap;
- No one voiceing strong opinion, so leaving "NamespaceMap" as is.
- NamespaceMap will be the same as it is today.

### IRI base for RDF
- Issue 601 - IRI base for RDF - want somewhere there is rendering?
- Decision: (Gary, Alexios, Kate)
  Prefix: https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/terms/[profile namespace]/[class or property name]
  Issue closed.

### NONE & NOASSERTION
- TODO: Open a separate PR if NOASSERTION for known unknowns for relationship set (followup from 629)
- TODO: Update PR to rename None & Nossertion to NoneElement & NoAssertionElement. [done]

### Where should getting started example be placed
- Getting started  & Canonical examples should be put into the spdx/spec/examples (since useful there)
- General documenting use-cases examples should document spdx-examples/3.0 repositories.
- Over time we should look for moving the example under spdx-3-model/examples
- Noted that examples for security need to be updated in model, then it could be run and validate examples.
- Looking at this as a target for 3.1

## Decisions
- The following paths were agreed on to use for serialization in order to put out examples and validate them.
  - https://spdx.org/schema/3.0.0/spdx-json-schema.json
  - https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-model.ttl
  - https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld
  - https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-json-serialize-annotations.ttl
- IRIs for RDF entities: https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/terms/[profile namespace]/[class or property name]
- The additional TTL files for the serialization need to be documented with
  "SPDX" and "serialization" in the names per OMG Architecturural Review Board
  (per Bob feedback)
- NamespaceMap will be the same as it is today.

## Action Items
- Kate & Jory to work with LF IT to create https://spdx.org/schema/ directory
  with same perms as /linux & /rdf
- Nisha and Adolfo to tackle SHAL2Go
