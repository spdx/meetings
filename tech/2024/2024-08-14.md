## Agenda

- Nisha looking for Example review.
- Awareness late changes for 3.0.1 (Kate, Gary)
- Branch/tag strategy on spec repo 
- Discussion of Zero vs Minimum (Joshua, Gary)


## Notes

### Examples repo
- Nisha is looking for review: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/85 

### Specification Publishing.
- Singular properties standardized.
- Diagrams update - Sean has generally positive per change log but spotted two minor things.
- Branch/tag strategy on spec repo - reminder, plan. --> postpone to subsequent meeting to implement.
   - Driven by localizing the content of the spec to enable translations as well.
   - Specifically we're changing it on the SPEC repo specifically.    Main branch will become the "under development" and a release branch.  
   - DIscussion to start it from 2.2.1 going forward. 
   - Do not want any changes against 3.0.1 - before making change;  so release candidate freezing will be the time.
   - Pull requests should respect branch names, via UI, can retarget to different branch. 
   - For reference the 2024-06-11 Tech minutes about branch and translation
     https://github.com/spdx/meetings/blob/main/tech/2024/2024-06-11.md.
   - In addition to making the branch changes, we will need to ensure that references to the branches in CI are also fixed,  and may impact other repositories (spec parser, model, etc.).  Art will check on this.
   - RECOMMENDATION:  After release candidate declared - then will consider making changes.    Art will prep the PR and put it out for review.   Gary will rename branch is "main".   Gary to send email about the change,  and then send email with the reopen.
   - Reminder from Arthit:  after we settle with this, also need to update the preferred branch/tag names for development as well in the Contribution guideline  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0.1/CONTRIBUTING.md

### Deliverables
- All Deliverables have model 3.0.1 content is the same.
   - OMG .pdf deliverable
   - SPDX release candidate deliverable - website for review window
   - ISO deliverable 

- Convention for 3.0 to point the latest.  Currently 3.0.0;  but will move to 3.0.1.
  - Note tooling will need to point to patch version. 
  - Agreement that 3.0 based for documentation, example here at:
    https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Core/Classes/CreationInfo/
- need to adjust process that when new patch releases come out we "republish" on top.

### Model 3.0.1
- Minimum Element for SpdxDocument and Bom
- Duplicating Bom and SpdxDocument:
  You could have a serialization for more than one Bom and more than one SpdxDocument.
  If you don't duplicate the elements how would you know.
- Joshua: no problem with duplication. Min 1 Bom is an unnessessary constraint.
- Gary: very reasonable to have generic collection with 0 elements.
- Decision: SpdxDocument cardinality 0--* for elements
- List of elements is normative. But rootElement is non-normative i.e. it is just a hint to say were to start.
- Decision: Bom cardinality 0--* for elements
- RootElement: it was carefully decided that the cardinality should be 0.


## Discussion topics for next meeting:

  - Where to go for 3.1?  How to handle translations?
  - Once agreed, update https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/development/v3.0.1/CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Symbolic reference links to latest version of 3.0 for external references.
    (ie. right now should be 3.0.0 content, but want to update to 3.0.1 in future)
  - gha: Use spdx3-validate to validate documents
    https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/96

- Suggested naming convention for SPDX v3 files
  OMG suggests we have to have only 1 extension per 1 filename
  ( .spdx and .json are good; .spdx.json is not)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/987
- Update CHANGELOG
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
- Need to document that Elements need to have NodeKind IRI and all other objects are blank
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/805
- Improve the SPDX ID property documentation
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/776
- Do we still want to update the SLSA Provenance version to be latest/neutral in the spec?
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/main/model/Build/Classes/Build.md?plain=1
- Need help reviewing diagrams
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/852
- Late change: Plural field names have been standardized to singular.

- Offline review for pending publishing/cleanup.
- Add the generated RDF files
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1067
