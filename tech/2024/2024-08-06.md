## Agenda

### Model 3.0.1

- licenseXml: Link license-list-XML to a specific version (v3.24.0)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/819
  - Swinslow: "Are we planning to keep updating it to the latest License List release repeatedly? E.g., I'm likely going to be pushing 3.25.0 in a few days, so this would be out of date soon. Does it make sense to just keep it pointing to the main branch?"
    - Since the main branch is going to be changing over time, and we have been including a static list in the past, let's just go with a fixed point in time now (which matches what we historically did on our first submission to ISO). 
- Decide about the inclusion of Legacy Text Template
  (cited in standardLicenseTemplate and in standardAdditionTemplate)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/747
    - Discussed in call, and closed.   
- [Security] Add text labels to bare URLs
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/812
    - Rose looking at it,  
- [Software] Update gitoid and Package URL refs
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/813
  - Art did additional research, and provided additional data.   review afterwards. 
  - For Package URL,
    - do we like to ref https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/ (with a specific commit)
    - or do we like to ref Annex E https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/annexes/pkg-url-specification/ ?
    - We should just refer to annex.   Art to make changes. 
- How JSON-LD context file of 3.0.1 should be named?
  `https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld` OR `https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.1/spdx-context.jsonld`
  See https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/802#discussion_r1698638134
    - everthing should have separately named JSONLD context file.   Every object is unique between version.   
    - Need to use the context that matches the version of the document.   
    - Concern over RDF way of consolidating.   Needs extra steps for resolving.   
    - Key is changing the IRI's in 3.0.1.    Need to convert every IRIs.    Possibly consider a lifting utility (older version to newer one) in future to make this less complicated.   It is a mechanical conversion. 
    - Max asks that we just change to 3.0.1 - where there is a change, and leave the rest as 3.0.0.   Spec parser would need to change.   
    - Mixed version numbers;  keep all same vs. tracking in what changes.    Challenge no volunteer to update spec parser, so we'll go with 3.0.1

## Spec 3.0.1

- Update relationshipType translation table (Annex A)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1019
    - Joshua will help review, also Rose on security-related
- Spec website: How do we like the URL aliases to work? (should v3.0 redirects to v3.0.1 ?)
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/1018
    - Delay until after 3.0.1 is published, and then get input from Gary & others. 

- Volunteers from China & Japan to start translating from 3.0.1 - looking for a .pdf

## Notes

- #819 merged
- https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/747 - The meeting decided to go with Option 2 (Keep Legacy Text Template)

These two need to be considered together:  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/796 & https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/1016

## Decision
- 3.0.1 for IRIs.
