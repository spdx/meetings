## Bugs Review

  - Bug 1191 - External license refs
      - Propose to address in 2.0
      - Change all license refs to allow for external references
          - \[externalID:\]LicenseRef-XXX
      - Need to change in many sections in the document
      - Need to change to absolute URI's in the RDF format (same
        approach we use for external references for files and packages).
        Similar to section 6.2.6.
      - Kate will update the document to permit optional external
        license references
      - Gary will update the RDF stuff
      - Gary to provide an example in RDF
      - Gary to validate whether the model needs to be udpated

## License Exception Model Discussion

  - Currently, we don't have a way to define custom exceptions for the
    With
  - Agree we will need to have it - question is for 2.0 or 2.1?
  - If we add example to SImpleLicenseInfo, it has the same fields as
    LicenseException
  - Change LicenseWithException to point to SimpleLicenseInfo for the
    exception - get rid of LicenseException class
  - Add example to SimpleLicenseInfo
  - WithExceptionOperator, OrLatorOperator naming - OK with naming
    change to With and Or
  - Agreed to keep the current LicenseException (at least for 2.0) and
    solve the problem with including custom license exception texts as
    part of 2.1
