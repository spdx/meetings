## External Identifiers

  - Review current proposal
  - External System Type ID - In RDF should it be an individual resource
    or a string type
      - String would be flexible
      - Individual would increase the ability to validate - better for
        RDF parsers
      - Leaning towards resource
          - ID could map to the spdx page for the predefined type (same
            approach as listed license IDs)
          - Could require unique resource ID's - could differentiate by
            starting with spdx.org if it -
          - Could have an "other" category with a required repository
            location and could be promoted to it's own type
          - Tentative decision to use unique resource ID's
  - Separate tags/sections for security?
  - Discussed tag names
      - ExternalReferenceType
      - ExternalReferenceIdentifier
      - ExternalReferenceRepository
