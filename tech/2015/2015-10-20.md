## External Identifiers

  - PackageExternalIdentifierTypes
      - Using unique ID - how do we handle the case when promoted to a
        listed ID
      - If 2 people specify two different unique URI's, how do we
        reconciled
      - We could include a list of other ID's in the table
  - Table headers were updated with new terms (see
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6LWnkh5GbMV9Xo5_zJ0wTNLROEIa4o1OU279YueI90>)
  - Default Repository Location
      - Need to define the semantics that if no repository location is
        specified, the default is used
  - External Reference Identifier Example
      - Could be used as a pointer to define the schema
      - Could be from the repo where the actual metadata on the packages
        is stored
  - Proposal with the type being a URI is a concern
  - Concern on having any proposal with Other - may need more data
      - Agree that we will table the Other proposals and bring it back
        up after the rest of the External identifiers are nailed
