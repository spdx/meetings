## Agenda

  - SPDX 2.0 release Feedback
  - Snippets
  - External package management system identifiers

## SPDX 2.0 Release Feedback

  - Need a bug for documenting the difference between "SPDX File" and
    "SPDX Document"
  - Best practices - should be updated
      - this is the Best Practices wiki page Jack/Gary referring to from
        the past
        <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/Best_Practices>
      - Jack will review/add additional best practices to the Wiki

## Snippets

  - Proposal to focus on collateral and postpone snippets until fall
  - Discussed use cases and priority
      - Model (should be) completed - Snippets were notionally on this
        older version of SPDX Model work-in-progress
        <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/Proposals/2012-02-01/Merged_Model_Proposal>
      - JavaScript creates a number of issues
      - Michael gave an example in healthcare.gov and suggested this is
        a more urgent issue due to JavaScript
          - Gary and Michael will provide examples
  - Structure in the tag/value document
      - Adding byte range makes it difficult to create
      - Can we make the byte range optional?
      - Should it be its own tag or just a sub-tag in the file?
        Postponed to a future discussion

## External / Package Management systems identifiers

  - Bill S articulated the benefit of having a place in the model to
    identify the package/versionnot by a URL / VCS, but rather by the
    unique package name/version within some namespace (package mgr)
      - e.g. (pseudo package manager command lines…)
      - apt get foo 1.1 (Debian / Ubuntu)
      - rpm install foo 1.1 (Redhat / CentOS)
      - pip install foo 1.1 (Python Package Index)
      - cpan get (Perl - Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)
      - maven get foo 1.1 (Maven Central)
  - Bill will file a Bugzilla bug report to track the issue

## Discussion: how to get developers to have good OSS hygiene

  - Suggest Markup / Put inside source files:
      - license notice
      - contributors notice
  - “Grading OSS projects” (Apache projects get A+ generally)
  - Michael: acknowledge expansion of mission of group?
  - If this happened, generating SPDX document becomes mechanical.
