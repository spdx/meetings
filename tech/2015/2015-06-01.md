## Snippets

  - Reviewed proposal on snippets (email:
    <http://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-tech/2015-June/02696.html>
    bug\#1000)
  - 2 proposals, separate tag "snippet" or have an optional byte range
    in the file to represent a snippet
      - Snippet class is clearer
      - optional byte range is easier to implement
      - Is there any duplication in fields? Likely not since all the
        fields in the snippet should refer to the snippet code and not
        the file.
      - Consensus forming on a separate Snippet class/section - Kate
        will write up a proposal for changes to the spec.
      - Will look
  - Is the relationship between snippets and files one to many or many
    to many?
      - Seems like many to many, but the snippet is a byte range in a
        specific file, so it needs to be 1 file to many snippets

  - Joint meeting with Legal - June 16

    practices - June 25
