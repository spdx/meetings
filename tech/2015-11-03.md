## Snippets

  - Proposal located at
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OknzNnY56UZhnj_VVPatirBrNze5cWXDx2fnKbBI_g/edit#heading=h.nmf14n>
  - Resolved snippet ID format
  - Resolved external document reference
  - Discussion on Name
      - In SPDXElement. Snippet is a subclass of SPDXElement which would
        imply name is a required property.
      - Proposal, make name optional at the SPDXElement level and add it
        in to SPDX Snippet spec
      - Alternative proposal to fix ontology class hierarchy to not
        require name in all cases
  - Bytes mandatory and lines are optional - all agreed
  - Bytes ranges - start at 1 or 0
      - Based on programming languages, would prefer 0
      - The RDF standard states 1
      - Agree to start at 1 - resolved
      - Add a comment to describe why we are starting at 1
  - Generally fixed up examples and cleaned up document
  - Snippet copyright - should it be included if it is the same as the
    file copyright?
      - Generally, yes - to be consistent with treatment of copyrights
        in other parts of the spec
      - Can be no-assertion
      - Should be documented in a best practice - Yev agreed to draft a
        best practice
  - Remaining open items for Snippets:
      - Name - proposal to make it optional, alternative includes not
        including a name in the snippet and changing the RDF model to be
        consistent.
      - Review snippet comment.
