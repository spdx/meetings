## RDF Terms Organization

  - Overview of Jack’s proposal for archiving old version of RDF terms
      - Under specifications/old versions can be referenced
      - Current version is always at spdx.org/rdf/terms
  - Agreed to Jacks proposal
  - Note: We do not have the turtle and xml versions of the terms for
    1.0 to archive. If anyone has a copy, please send to Jack otherwise
    we will just go with the HTML version for 1.0.
  - Discussion on using git for the spec repository or should we use
    wiki.
  - Agree to have the wiki point to the main website
