## Notes

Review of last week’s minutes – minutes updated and will be posted to
the wiki.

Review Kate’s UML diagram:

Discussion on the relationship between the SPDX File and the
information. There are basically 2 different conceptual models – one
proposed by Kate and a second model where the SPDX Package contains many
of the relationships.

A discussion on the impact to the tag/value format and to the RDF format
was discussed. A discussion on the impact to Beta was discussed.

## Actions resulting from the discussion

  - Obtain information on how the beta customers will use the SPDX spec
    – will they use the tag/value format or the RDF format? The
    current assumption is that the beta customers will use the
    spreadsheet and will not care what the underlying format is. A
    questionnaire has been sent to the beta sites through the business
    teams.
  - Draft the UML model for the current RDF tools implementation (Gary)
    – will compare and discuss next week
  - Document the new fields that need to be added to implement Kate’s
    proposed model (Kate)
