## License XML

  - Gary will follow up with Jilayne and Paul to schedule a joint
    meeting
  - Should the scope of license XML be more general than just listed
    licenses?
      - Need to create some kind of namespace to make the ID’s unique
      - Will discuss on the joint call

## What’s next?

  - Proposal to focus on adoption
  - Continue with the XML license definitions
  - Notices file – proposal to update the standard to help automate the
    generation of notice files from an SPDX document
      - Including a standard license will mask the original license
        text, making it difficult to both use the SPDX license ID’s and
        have enough information for generating the notice file
      - Will take this
