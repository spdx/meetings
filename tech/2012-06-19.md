## Standard License List

  - Bug 1036 – reassigned to Gary to make the tools consistent with the
    RDF spec
  - 1022 – no longer valid – Peter will double check the examples in the
    PDF spec to make sure there are no longer any inconsistencies
  - 1023 – Resolved in the last call, closing
  - 1026 – cut/paste error – Kate will fix
  - 1027 – Proposal to change the spec appendix and RDF (not the main
    section 4 in the spec itself) Current text in the spec appendix is
    good enough – Peter will update the RDF html to reflect the same
    text.
  - 1035 – set target milestone to 2.0
  - 1037 - general discussion on standardizing the terms on SPDX
    Standard Licenses
      - Agree to document the standard license model in the PDF document
      - Agree to target this for 1.1
      - List of fields documented in bug XXX
      - Agree to do the license headers/notices (Peter’s proposal)
      - Add a bug for adding grammar for tag/value – target 1.1
      - Agree to provide a spec for the tag/value form of the standard
        licenses
