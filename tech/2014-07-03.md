## RDF generation

Closing on last week discussion on the RDF documentation

  - Proposal is option C1 (static web pages generated from Protege)
      - Static web pages should version specific
      - will need to manually verify that the RDF is in sync
      - Agree to go with option C1
  - Gary will start populating Protégé
  - In the RDF appendix, there is a definition of syntax for allowed
    terms. When we move to Protege generated RDF pages, we will move
    these definitions to the specification as the source and either copy
    to the RDF web pages or just do a reference to the spec.
  - In maintaining the spec and RDF pages, where possible the spec will
    be the master and the RDF pages will be created by copying and
    pasting the spec information.

## Schedule

  - Targeting Linux Con Europe
      - We were not able to get through enough of the spec
      - Documenting the RDF terms is critical path
      - Kate will send Gary the latest docs Gary will send Kate any
        updated terms definitions

## Discussion on the website

  - Problems navigating in the wiki page
  - Agree to redirect to the main web pages to resolves some of the
    issues
