## Views on SPDX Documents

  - Discussed the SPDX document views.
  - See the “Thomas: Add data “views” to the specification “topic in
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJqWGU02ynzrJ5CvmX1z2mBssOSpuBvuKene8jVJGNI>
    for details on this and previous discussions on the topic
  - Agreed on the call to have the views be a separate enhancement from
    the profiles
  - Left open two possible proposals for discussion next week:
      - Create a new document type “SpdxViewDocument” which has a
        mandatory reference to the detailed SPDX document. All other
        fields are the same as an SPDX document except they are
        optional.
          - Pros: Easy to identify a view document, can easily specify
            the mandatory and optional fields in the RDF Schema
          - Cons: Would duplicate the SPDX document schema and create
            some maintenance challenges for the spec.
      - Add a relationship “SpdxDocumentViewOf” which would apply at the
        document level. If this relationship is present, only the
        document level properties would be mandatory.
          - Pros: Simple addition to the spec
          - Cons: Mandatory fields could not be specified in the RDF
            Schema since it is conditional on the presence of a
            relationship
