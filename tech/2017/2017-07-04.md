## SPDX Spec Git Repo

  - Thomas has moved the SPDX spec over to github.com/spdx
  - Automatically generates HTML on commits
  - Some problems remain
      - Linking to sections not working (limitation of markdown)
  - Gitbook used for publishing HTML
  - NPM package can be made available
      - Agreed that NPM package can be published
  - Discussed contributing and branching strategies
      - Three alternatives discussed:
          - Master is the current release, Develop branch used for
            development (default branch)
          - Release branches – 3.0, etc.
          - Only a master branch with pull requests used for any changes
            – would need to create maintenance branch
          - Agreed on having release branches – Kate will write up for
            review

## Next SPDX Specification

  - Same model for listed licenses and non-listed licenses
      - Including the matching guidelines (template text)
      - Breaking the proposal into 2 separate proposals:
          - Remodeling the listed license and extracted licenses to have
            more common fields
              - Should also consider extracted licenses
          - Bringing some of the license XML input formats into the
            output formats so they can be reliably referenced by tools
