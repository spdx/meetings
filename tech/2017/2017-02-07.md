## Q\&A / ideas

  - Thomas has added several ideas to the specification section on the
    project list wiki
    (http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical\_Team/Ideas\_List\#SPDX\_Specification\_in\_MarkDown)
  - SPDX Specification in Markdown that can be displayed on Github –
    Thomas is prototyping
  - Package Manage examples – document on Wiki or github
  - SPDX Views for legal (subsetting spec for legal views)
      - Need for views to breakdown the larger SPDX document into things
        that can be worked on
      - Involves a workflow with reviews, engineering editors
      - Would like to get to best practices, but we should start with
        case studies and reviewing current implementations and
        implementation challenges
