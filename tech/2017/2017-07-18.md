  - All projects making progress – details in gitter

## Spec Issues

  - Logged at <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues>
  - Updating license – Kate will update issue – no concerns about moving
    to CC by 4.0
  - Each sentence suggested – consensus that one sentence per line would
    make sense with additional tooling, but since we do not have such
    tooling we agreed that it should not be pursued
  - Updated license list – Upgrade in the next fix release, once the
    automation is in place
  - SPDX redirects – Kate taking issue

## Next SPDX Specification

    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJqWGU02ynzrJ5CvmX1z2mBssOSpuBvuKene8jVJGNI/edit>
  - Request for annotation type
      - Scenario – additional patent information and reviews
      - Suggestion that we change cardinality for annotation to allow
        for more than one annotation types
      - Agree we could add the multiple annotations and change the
        cardinality
      - Target 2.2
      - Suggested annotations – patent, trademark, export
      - Proposed license annotation type license – inconclusive,
        decision postponed
          - Discussed the possibility of adding annotations to the
            license – could be complex to express in tag/value for
            complex license types
