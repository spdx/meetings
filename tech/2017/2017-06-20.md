## GitHub SPDX Project Architecture

  - Review architecture for github spdx project
  - Proposal – use github webhooks for the user integration and
    integrate multiple back-end scanners through a REST based API
  - Reference: <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-github/wiki/Architecture>
  - Yev suggested integrating with a Continuous Integration system may
    be a better approach
      - Yev suggested generating outside of github was an overkill,
        Thomas agreed
      - Gary suggested focus could be on open source project originators
        where dependencies are not as prevalent – example, NodeJS where
        there are only 2-3 files
      - Gary responded that there is a separate project proposal for
        integration system hooks, and this project is focused on github
  - Discussion on the multiple scanner integration
      - Could use the integration for a build oriented SPDX generator
        (such as the Maven build) – Gary will build an integration once
        the tool is available
      - Existing scanners can be “wrapped” by the API – either a command
        line or a library call
  - Discussion on authentication
      - Primary mechanism would be github
      - Need to authenticate external services if used
      - First release, we could scope it to everything running on a
        local server

## Other Topics

  - Further discussion on next SPDX spec postponed to next week, waiting
    larger quorum
  - Thomas has first draft of OpenChain specification 1.0 in Markdown,
    building HTML via GitBook:
    <https://github.com/tsteenbe/openchain-spec>
      - work-in-progress; history being re-written
