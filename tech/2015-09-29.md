## External Identifiers

  - Reviewing document at
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6LWnkh5GbMV9Xo5_zJ0wTNLROEIa4o1OU279YueI90>
  - Significant changes since last time based on feedback:
      - optional 3rd part of identifier ‘External Repository Location’
        (fulfill need to say ‘which debian distro archive’ or which
        Maven repository (if not default Maven Central)
      - External Identifier relaxed wording to allow ‘whichever level of
        specificity (e.g. package, version, architecture…) the external
        system supports and the SPDX Document creator provides.’
      - Appendix list of Package Managers / Code Repositories edited to
        exclude general build tools (gradle), and to be inclusive of
        forges such as github, sourceforge, codeplex, googlecode
  - Updates made realtime to the document during meeting
  - Section 3.20.4
      - Reviewed text - generally agreed with proposal
      - External Repository Location - Agreed that this is not always
        going to be a URL - should be more general (e.g. for Debian ‘deb
        <http://httpredir.debian.org/debian> jessie main’ expresses
        which distro / set of packages)

<!-- end list -->

  - Section 3.20.6
      - Should the externalSystemIDType be an individual or a string?
      - Individuals need to be defined ahead of time, would constrain
        ongoing development
      - Leaning towards string, but leaving this open
  - Delimiter for tag/value selection
      - :: is used in Perl (REJECT THIS?)
      - Propose \#\#\# (REJECT THIS?)
          - Used as comments in tag/value
      - Propose single quote to enclose location (REJECT THIS)
      - We could use the same approach as ArtifactOf where there are
        multiple tags
      - Proposed solution A - consistent with ArtifactOf
          - 3 separate tags "PackageExternalIdentifierType",
            "PackageExternalIdentfierID",
            "PackageExternalIdentifierLocation".
          - Use optional <text> if any of the special characters or
            multiple lines is used
      - Proposed solution B - Consistent with Checksum
          - Use a colon to separate the fields
          - Optionally wrap the individual fields with <text></text> if
            multi-line or uses any special characters (e.g.
            debian:<text>libmtp-common/1.1.9-2/all</text>:<text>deb
            <http://httpredir.debian.org/debian> jessie main</text>)
  - Reviewed tables in the Appendix
      - BNF grammar may be too high a bar - suggest having a link to an
        external description which may (or may not) have a BNF grammar
          - Changed last column to reference the external definition of
            the ID
  - Question - Is the <text> optional for those fields that use it? Not
    clear from the spec - seems to indicate optional in the description,
    but there are one line examples where <text> is used - should
    clarify spec
  - Bug in spec - section 5.1.6 - RDF term and example for
    LicenseID/LicenseId is inconsistent - should be LicenseId to be
    consistent with Ontology.
