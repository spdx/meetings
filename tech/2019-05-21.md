  -   - License matches for text may not be precise using many tools
      - License matching guidelines are only implemented in the SPDX
        tools:
        <https://github.com/spdx/tools/blob/master/src/org/spdx/compare/LicenseCompareHelper.java>
      - Different policies may impact which license terms refer to which
        licenses
      - A URL approach was used for Maven POM files

  - Nisha will look into enhancing tools-python to support the TERN use
    cases

  - Quick fix for Tern to be SPDX compliant is to simply add
    "LicenseRef-" in front of each license and "AND" it e.g. "MIT BSD
    GPL2+" =\> "LicenseRef-MIT AND LicenseRef-BSD AND LicenseRef-GPL2+"
