## GSoC

  - 4 projects selected
  - Looking for mentoring possibility for one of the students who should
    have been selected but wasn’t
  - Currently in community bonding
  - Active coding about a month away, will start having the students
    join the call at that time
  - Discussion on the approach for repos:
      - Up to student and mentor – Gary can create a repo in SPDX, can
        use a branch in an existing SPDX repo, or can use the student’s
        repo and transfer to SPDX at the end of the project
  - Question on Gitter
      - We’ll use the public SPDX channel for most communications

## SPDX 2.2

  - Release done over the weekend
  - development/v2.2.1 branch created and made the default branch
  - Thanks to the many contributors and reviewers – especially Alexios,
    Steve, Thomas, William, Kate and Gary
  - Rendering for the v2 draft has some problems – William is looking
    into

## SPDX 2.2.1

  - Focused on the ISO standard
  - Conversion to the standard as first phase and move to word for
    submission as a second phase

## Containers

  - See slides for the overview presented by Nisha
  - Issue with download URL not being a URL
  - Issue with the size – 7MB for the example shown
  - Issue with difference in representation in the layer descriptions
    and in the flattened image
      - Name are based on the SHA checksum, not a natural filename
  - Is it possible to define an SPDX document for each layer
      - Yes – external document refs can be used
      - Discussion on tooling support
  - Discussion on different relationship types for the manifest.json and
    config.json
  - How do we account for content addressable “Packages”?
  - What does an external reference look like for deployments?
  - Can we compose/decompose SPDX documents?
  - Can we provide pipeline context?
  - General agreement that the relationships between docs and pipeline
    is related to the linking proposal Santiago is working on
