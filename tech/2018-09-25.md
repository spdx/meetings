Gary and Rohit discuss merging of last commits.

James started working through his slides.

Gary & James discussed how to handle different camel cases between
representations. Data object live on its own, independent of
implementation. James asserts that XML schema namespace should be able
to handle this.

Some of these concepts can be merged:

  - Group - could be Relationship.
  - Dependency - investigate if Relationshp works here.
  - License Information - how can we associate with a SPDX license list
    version.

Vulnerabilities â€“ data comes from NIST data directly.

Future discussions

  - see list from James
  - Gary and James to resolve NIEM camel case issue, likely to establish
    with loose coupling for RDF. NIEM has it as a must for upper camel
    case. Current SPDX spec has lower camel case specified creating an
    inconsistency.
  - Use of ID, in various software implementations

Will pick up discussion on Oct. 9.
