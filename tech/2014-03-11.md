## SPDX 2.0 next steps and discussion

  - Discussion on model changes to support the instance diagrams
      - Proposal to add a "ChangeLog" to relationship
          - Issue with changelog only being applicable to one type of
            relationship
          - Should we have subclasses of SpdxElementRelationship instead
            of or in addition to the relationship type
          - Do we need to describe the file additions/subtractions?
              - Could be computed from 2 complete SPDX documents?
              - Supporting a changelog is more compact
              - The SPDX file represents a deliverable, which should be
                the exploded view
              - Both the changed file SPDX and exploded SPDX point to
                the same GIT commit
          - Need further discussion on the patch use cases and modeling
  - Discussion on packages and relationships
      - Anything that is licenenseable will be an SpdxElement
      - Distros and Packages are different
      - Packages are currently defined (subclass of SpdxElement)
      - Distros are not currently defined - perhaps we could add them as
        a new subclass of SpdxElement
  - Moving usage from SpdxElement to SpdxElementRelationship
      - Usage is important to license obligations
          - Should be modeled "one level above"
      - Reviewed current usage enumerations
      - Tentatively agreed to move the property to
        SpdxElementRelationship -will confirm after the tech team has
        had a chance to think through the proposal more carefully
