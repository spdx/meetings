    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6LWnkh5GbMV9Xo5_zJ0wTNLROEIa4o1OU279YueI90>
  - Reviewed proposal for 3.20.5 and 3.20.6 with Kate
      - Discussed single line with parsed fields vs. multiple fields
      - If multiple fields, it should be broken into multiple
        subsections
      - If single line, we could have the repository location at the end
        then we only need to worry about allowing spaces in the ID
        itself
          - We could not come up with any examples of ID's with spaces,
            but we were all nervous that such a schema for ID naming
            could exist
      - Discussed multiple fields
          - Order of the section - should type come first or should ID?
          - Now that they are multiple fields, what should the
            cardinality be (e.g. multiple ID's under the same type)?
      - Kate will think about the proposed changes and we will discuss
        next week
