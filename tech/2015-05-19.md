## Agenda

  - Use cases for best practices review
  - JSON for license list
  - Snippets
  - Ninka - new version supports SPDX

## JSON File discussion

  - Overview provided of the JSON file and Kyle's contribution
  - Do we add this now?
      - Agreed OK to add
  - Do we make it public?
      - Proposal to wait until Linux con to announce
          - Allows for time for feedback
          - Once available we can create a link
          - Make a news article that we're looking at it
  - Proposal REST API's for license list
  - Generally agreed that the name "licenses.json" was OK, but there may
    be some future conflict if we add other JSON formats (e.g. with more
    detail).
      - Agreed to start a thread on the name of the license list file on
        the tech list

## Snippets

  - Reviewed examples
  - jQuery/Sizzle as another example
  - Best practice should be to keep the file separate - but the
    JavaScript best practice is to combine the file

## Use Case Review/Examples

  - Jack added some SPDX 2.0 examples at
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/Best_Practices#Examples>
  - Create an examples git repository
  - Example with snippets using comments - mashup with Java File
  - Use our own tools
  - Can attach use cases
  - Action - Use the Wiki to add more examples. Jack will continue to
    work on the specific examples.
