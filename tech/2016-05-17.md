## Resolving 2.1 targeted Bugs

  - Made the ArtifactOf deprecated per last week's discussions
  - Case Sensitive license ID's
      - discussed and identified compatibility problems if we make it
        case insensitive - will raise with the legal team (e.g. RDF
        terms are case sensitive, other tooling for the tag value may be
        doing case sensitive compares)
  - Discussed license expression ABNF - resolved bugs raised by David W.
  - Several other bugs reviewed, updated, and resolved (see the bugs
    database for details)

Next week ,we will go over the external references appendix.
