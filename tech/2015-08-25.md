  - Kate Stewart
  - Bill Schineller
  - Scott Sterling
  - Yev Bronshteyn
  - Hassib Khanafer

## External Package Identifiers

  - Yev will update google docs to reflect decisions made in the last
    discussion on the topic

## Version 2.1

  - Include:
      - snippets
      - external identifiers and security
      - meta tags
  - Target completion by compliance summit in November with a fallback
    plan for Collab Summit

## Meta Tags

  - Reference Wiki page
    <http://wiki.spdx.org/view/Technical_Team/SPDX_Meta_Tags>
  - Will allow for license expression
  - Name for the tag (SPDX-License-Identifier: )
      - Discussion on using different terms - Consensus on the original
        proposal
      - Maps to license information in file
      - Multiple SPDX-License-Identifier will be treated as multiple
        licenses expressions in the License Information in File
  - Where should the metatag be placed?
      - Normally at the top of the file, but it should follow the
        convention of the language used
      - Near/in the context of the code it is associated with
      - Not prescriptive, more recommendations
  - Do we include anything on compiled strings?
      - Proposal to not exclude the compiled strings
  - Defining the end of license expression -
      - Use the same rules as the license expressions - whitespace after
        license ID, expressions must use parenthesis "(" ")"
  - Examples
      - SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT blah foobar \[OK since there is
        whitespace after a license ID\]
      - SPDX-License-Identifier: (MIT) blah foobar \[OK\]
      - SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL with classpath-exception \[Not OK -
        the expression must be enclosed by the parenthesis. This will be
        interpreted as GPL\]
      - SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL with classpath-exception) \[OK\]
  - for best results always surround licenseid/expression with
    PARENTHESES
  - Copyrights will not be explicitly added in this release, although we
    may reference guidelines on how to document copyrights

## File Type Application

  - Section 4.3.1 - Application as defined by Mime Type is very general,
    and may not be what is intended
  - New wording suggested by Yev - APPLICATION if the file can be
    executed (natively or with an interpreter) to provide functionality.
  - Agreed to wording - proposed changing 2.1 - Add bug, Yev will log it
    as a bug \[Bug added - ID 1311\]

## Agenda topics

  - Next week we will cover Snippets
  - Follow-on discussions to close on the External IDs + Security
