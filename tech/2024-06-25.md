### Operations profile overview
- Export control use cases

    - Start a branch specific to profile.  
    - Bring in cryptography after the branch created
    - Contributions for cryptography from FOSSA & IBM need to be incorporated.
    - AI:  Kate to create a scratch pad;  and modeling to start
    - Discussion to have a meet up at OSS EU.

### RDF License Definition
- blocking validation of examples.
- Gary focusing on translation right now,  and Alexios agrees that translation.

### Duplicate content type
- Some concern over making this change in a minor release.
- Concern that anyone using previous version - may need to transform. 
- Small change,  Classes in software should use the property in core. 

### Visualization Demo
- Application crashed because of duplication of content type. 
- Prototype demonstrated, and built in self checking incorporated
- Relationships will be modeled as edges in future version.
