## Agenda

### Topic 1 – “License Namespaces”
#### Topic 1 Discussion Objectives:
* Agree on specifically which problems we plan to solve and which problems we won’t solve as it relates to referencing license texts which are not included on the SPDX license list
* For any problems we agree to solve, identify what work needs to be done, who will work on it and by when
* If we have enough time, agree on the syntax we will use for referencing external license texts
* If we have enough time, agree on the process we will implement to register and maintain external license texts

#### Topic 1 Agenda:

* Discuss specific problems we are trying to solve with namespaces and decide if the SPDX community should solve those problems (see problem list below) 10 minutes
* Discuss the policy the SPDX legal team would use as it relates to external license texts (see policy considerations below) 15 minutes
* Discuss what work needs to be done (who, what, when) 15 minutes
* Discuss syntax and process 10 minutes

### Topic 2 – “License Snippets in Source Files” – If there is time available
#### Topic 2 Discussion Objects:

* Agree if this is a problem we want to tackle
* Agree on outstanding remaining issues which need to be resolved
* Agree on the who, what and when for the remaining issues

#### Topic 2 Agenda:
* Discuss the problem statement
* Discuss remaining work that needs to be done (who, what, when)

## Notes

Below is a list of namespace problem statements related to “license namespaces” we’ve collected from various threads and conversations:

1. Unable to reference or locate LicenseRef text where the reference is in one SPDX document and the text is outside that document.
  * This may well just be a documentation and communication issue – see the Change Proposal: Clarify External Licenses in SPDX Documents for a proposed solution: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B8dSMahp8Klao06oXg8DcEFBq22zPEhJIwqReIRtZCc/edit#heading=h.9qk7r7pzuiyc
  * Discussed: This is primarily a documentation and communication issue; not proposing an actual substantive change. Change is to better document what it already does.
  * **Decision**: Add clarity to both Annex D and recommend adding a new Annex talking about linking more generally.
  * **ACTION**: Come back to who / what / when, including publicizing

2. Unable to reference or locate text for non-listed licenses when used in license expressions within source files
  * See the REUSE for their proposed solutions to this issue: REUSE says to use LicenseRef, and says where to put the corresponding license text
  * Gary: recommend not imposing this on REUSE org since they haven't promoted this
  * Jilayne: e.g. at ARM, had made up a LicenseRef for a custom binary-only license; included copy of license in distribution with license ID at top
  * Another  example is KDE:  https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy
  * Philippe: Assumes that the license identifier always lives in a repo along with documentation that will explain what that LicenseRef means; when the file is pulled outside that repo, don't know what it means or how to correlate it. Need a way to reference it.
  * Mark: This would be an error case causing a human analyst to look at it manually and resolve
  * Jilayne: If a project is following REUSE guidelines, use LicenseRef together with license text, if someone downstream takes that file out of context, won't know what to do with the LicenseRef - is that the concern?
    * REUSE requires that all license IDS in the headers need to have texts that use same name, e.g., /LICENSES/LicenseRef-My-Cool-NonLicense.txt  (also see KDE example https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy )
  * Philippe: Take something like in Python, will have their own LicenseRefs to reference things not on SPDX list
    * Gary: This is problem #3 below - package managers
  * Philippe: People assume that e.g. KDE-defined LicenseRefs are stable and usable elsewhere
  * Alexios: KDE requirements: If you use LicenseRef, must also put the text there (https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#License_Texts)
  * Does SPDX org need to solve this, or should we work with REUSE to help them solve it?
    * Jilayne: REUSE created a way to do this; SPDX should possibly add (in Annex D?) to close the loop, recommend pointing to REUSE. Don't know what more on this particular issue we could do.
    * Karsten: Is REUSE using LicenseRefs in this way just because that's the only option? Is there a better tool?
    * Gary: Let's ask REUSE
  * **Decision**: No action in SPDX specifically at this point, Will work with REUSE to align with them; if REUSE says namespace would be really valuable, would bring back to team
  * **ACTION**:  communicate with REUSE as per above - need to decide who will take lead on that and how to facilitate that communication

3. Unable to reference or locate text for non-listed licenses when license expressions are used in package manager meta-data files
  * Mark: There's a limited number of package managers; we can work with communities to improve this upstream
  * Gary: According to Kyle, package managers are resistant, even to expressions; probably won't use namespaces at all
  * Mark: Package managers are resistant to having "computable" content in metadata
  * Sebastian: Difference between programming language package managers vs. distros - the latter may make computable decisions - eg. (Fedora/RHEL) RPM .spec files
  * Gary: Trying to get package managers to adopt even simple license IDs is very difficult; can't imagine they will accept namespaces
  * Mark: Difficult to get existing ones to switch; new package management systems could adopt this, e.g. this is a constant pain for Rust
  * Jilayne: When NPM started requiring SPDX IDs, we saw an uptick in people asking to have their licenses added. Overall good, but not all licenses submitted are appropriate to add to the SPDX License List - this is the right direction, but also has resulted in some questionable licenses that the legal team has had to deal with, but then agian it's an opportunity to suggest using an existing license
   * education opportunity is not necessarily SPDX in-scope, but something to consider encouraging OSI to
  * Should we include namespace to solve package manager issue in the problem statements?
   * Sebastian: Against namespaces for this use case; if package managers want to support SPDX, no problem with them having a separate field for the corresponding license text. As they move to SPDX, no harm in just including license text this way.
    * Mark: We should suggest to package managers that they implement the field and/or use REUSE; guidance on using LicenseRef
    * Steve: explain things better, yes, but don't need to add new functionality / namespaces
    * Jilayne: for explaining things better, not adding to spec for this "problem" and then revisit as needed
    * Karsten: we need to reflect reality, even if it's a license that is problematic; namespace allows mapping; yes, want to solve this
    * Gary: Suggest Mark go back to Rust; if can find one package manager willing to work with us on this, then we could at least test solutions with them
    * Sebastian: Debian's view, all packages should be buildable without an internet connection; requiring an internet connection to lookup namespaces doesn't work
    * Philippe: existing proposal with Python on use of LicenseRef; could also with SUSE, which they prefix with "suse"
    * Gary: open question to find a package manager / organization that's willing to publicly accept that namespaces are useful to them and willing to work with us on it
    * Jilayne: could maybe revisit this later for the spec if and when there's someone working with us
  * **Decision**: Don't have consensus on this yet; challenge to team to come back with package managers willing to work with us on implementing a namespace solution; if none, agree wouldn't be a problem to tackle
  * **ACTION**: people to discuss with package managers to get an idea on that question (in next week, if possible)

4. Ability to efficiently reference common licenses which are not on the SPDX License List, including those which do not meet the SPDX license inclusion principles
Reworded: Should we have a way to efficiently reference common licenses which are not on the SPDX License List, regardless of context (e.g. not specific to source code / Documents / package managers)
* Should we implement this?
  * Yes: 9; No: 3
  * Sebastian: Feel strongly that existing linking mechanisms are sufficient; feel that this should not be covered in SPDX 3.0
  * Gary: If covering in 2.3, will presumably come up in 3.0
  * Sebastian: OK if it solves people's issues for 2.x, can come back to discuss in 3.0. reason for hesitancy re: 3.0 is looking into more powerful way to linking and discovering things; want to avoid having a special case for licenses
  * **Decision**: Include in problem statement, with caveat can change our mind in 3.0; as part of "who / what / how" discussion, will decide whether to actually proceed with this

5. Ability to advertise the availability of license lists other than the SPDX license list
* Should we implement this?
  * Yes: 5; No: 7
  * Steve: Difference between "advertising / promoting" vs. "enable the linking or finding of" - personally not in favor of advertising but more in favor of linking/finding
  * Gary: Yes, this is specific to advertising in the "promoting" sense
  * Jilayne: This is conflicting to the goal of the project; still have fear that any "codifying" of standard LicenseRef methodology (namespace, etc.) will only dilute SPDX License List
  * Philippe: Understood "advertise" not as in "ads" but more as in "make known";
* **Decision**: Need to table, no consensus yet

6. Should  namespace proposal help solve issue of capturing variants of licenses which match the same listed license per the matching guidelines?
  * Steve: understanging using BSD-3-Clause - vanity versions that under matching guidelines would be simply "BSD-3-Clause", but could namespace proposal allow ability to capture all these vanity versions
  * Poll: Yes: 2, No: 6
* **Decision**: Mostly no, may be worth a few minutes to discuss further

* Before going on to solutions: need to be REALLY clear about what we're solving and what we aren't (for 2.3)

## Other license related issues for future consideration:
* Use of SPDX license data as "reference text" for licensing (e..g., people pull license text from SPDX when creating their license documentation)
 * Not really part of the namespace discussion
 * Move elsewhere in the minutes
* Snippets in source files discussion - might need another meeting, not related to namespace; Sebastian to facilitate; see https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/464 for summary, specifically https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/464#issuecomment-1140023288


## Defer to next discussion:

Below is a list of policy considerations for when we should use “license namespaces”:
1. Licenses submitted for external namespaces MUST NOT match the text of existing SPDX listed licenses (at the time of submittal)
2. Licenses submitted SHOULD NOT meet the license inclusion guidelines (otherwise – they should be submitted to be included on the license list)
3. Licenses namespaces MUST HAVE a contact
4. Licenses within the namespaces MUST BE maintained
5. Licenses within the namespace MUST BE publicly accessible

## Next meeting

We will have our next meeting next Friday 10 June 2022 at the same time 8AM Pacific

* Complete the discussion on which problems we are solving
  * We will use the [SPDX decision making governance process](https://github.com/spdx/governance/blob/main/5._Governance.md#3-decision-making) for reaching a conclusion on the problem statements within the first 30 minutes of the call
* Discuss the policy related questions (above)
* Agree on the who/what/when
