## Topics

  - Discussed survey on barriers to adoption. Michael volunteered Pierre
    to work with Jack on this. Scott will track down previous work from
    the SPDX end-user summit at Cisco. Publish the survey on the SPDX
    list and maybe other places like the LF Facebook page, FossBazaar,
    ect...
  - Ibrahim discussed some of his ideas on what we need to move SPDX
    forward including outreach to LF members. Need a more formal
    governance although he's willing to share want we have and gather
    feedback. If we're successful in recruiting companies then we need
    an onboarding process -- where do they focus resources they're
    committing.
  - Michael questioned if we need a system to track and coordinate our
    outreach to companies and projects. He's going to investigate some
    cloud based CRM type systems.
  - Jack's provided a update on the website. He's been doing a great job
    reorganizing and getting broken links fixes. Thanks Jack\!
