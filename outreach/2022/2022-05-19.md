### Updates

#### Podcast

* Joshua has enlisted a 'co-conspirator' ("muahaha! can't put more info on the record yet")

    * Exciting stuff; very positive for SPDX; Joshua is looking forward to seeing what comes out of it

    * This will help things get off the ground more quickly

#### Website

* Sebastian demonstrated the front page of the rebuilt website

    * Will be a static site, generated from a Git repository!

    * YAML config and Markdown pages

    * Randomly generated member list on the front page

    * Site generator written in Clojure

    * More functionality coming soon, but basic layout and CSS is done

    * Would be good to decide where tooling implementors should propose that their own tools be added


### Community news

* Looking for talk to be submitted to Open Source Summit EU about SPDX - volunteers?
