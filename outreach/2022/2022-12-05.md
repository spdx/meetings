## Notes

Discussion about a diagram showing the technical structure of the rebuilt SPDX website. Modular design allows for flexbility, but concerns within group about the compatibility with the Linux Foundation's hosting infrastructure. Any container runtime will be sufficient, but specifics require collaboration with LF.
