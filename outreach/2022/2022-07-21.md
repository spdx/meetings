### Landscape

* SC had a call w/James & Padmalav at Wipro
* Created a github issue template for adding a new company/project to the landscape
* Currently in [outreach repo](https://github.com/spdx/outreach)
* VMB suggests moving it to the [landscape repo](https://github.com/spdx/sbom-landscape)
* Kate points out that there's a list of tools to add in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1jFIYihB-IyT0gv7E_KoSjLbwNGmu_wOXBs6siemXA/edit)
* The doc needs a bit of cleanup
* She suggests using the taxonomy in this document so it matches NTIA
* Will credit Wipro for helping on the announcement when it's ready.
* Validate the entries of this doc
* See what is moving to 2.3, what's staying at 2.2, whether they still want to be listed, whether there are new entries
* Get member companies/supporters onto the landscape in v2.0
* Logos for our SPDX tools so we can add to Landscape.  AI:  Kate to ask LF Creative Services folks.  Java, Go, Python, Validator.

### Meeting rescheduling?

* Frequency and day?
* Half hour on Mondays? 6AM PT?
* Works for the three of us; need to confirm with Joshua, Alexios, Bob
* AI: VMB will email the outreach list to confirm

### 2.3

* Kate's worked on spec, updating version numbers & other minor edits
* SC and/or Gary need to review
* [Issue for tracking 2.3 release prep](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/750)
* Can see a [rendered preview of 2.3 spec](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/) now thanks to William
* v2.3-rc 1 will be coming out soon; 2 week countdown to release at that point
* Would need someone to draft release candidate;   & summary for release.
* [PRs summarise the differences](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pulls) (several PRs for this)
* Most of the summary is in [#752](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/752)
* Going to see whether Josh (not Joshua) can help with this
