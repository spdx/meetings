## Attendees

## Notes

Discussion of apparent apathy of tooling vendors to SPDX community interest - is this due to lack of confidence in their tooling, or another reason?

Discussion of the SPDX Outreach Team charter. Some edits were proposed, and it was agreed to bring it to the Steering Committee as the final draft.

Update from Phil regarding the ecosystem picture. Latest version has two slides; Phil will draw attention to it on the SPDX Outreach Team mailing list.
