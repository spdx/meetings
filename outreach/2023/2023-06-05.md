## Notes

### Ambassadors
- tool to consider: https://orbit.love/
- identify areas/conferences and then serach who can present
- more open source communities, as well
- reservation to using "SPDX Ambassador" title, as it might hurt credibility
- use it internally
- SPDX Speaker's Bureau, to ask for a speaker
- future speaking opportunities in a private GitHub repo (spdx/internal)
- Internal repo created with an outreach fold: https://github.com/spdx/internal/tree/main/outreach
- Everyone on this call + Kate has been added with access to the repo

### DoD misperceptions
- talk on behalf of DOD CDAO
- "because it's ISO, it costs money"
- Bob corrected
- always use "freely available ISO standard" and point to links for download (iso.org and spdx.dev)
- standardizing to GitLab

### GitLab
- people got involved
- Kate setting up meeting with senior-level GitLab person
- they pointed to CDX-to-SPDX conversion utility
- need thumbs-up and comments to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6838
- need an implementation of "save to SPDX" similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/cyclonedx/convert.go
- Thomas/OST has been in contact with GitLab
