# SPDX Outreach Team meetings - 17 July 2023

## Agenda
* Making SPDX easier to use (e..g for software packages)
* website
* quotes on PR

## Attendees
- Alexios Zavras
- Gary O'Neall
- Phil Odence


## Notes

### website
- LF has lots of info (sitemap, content, etc.)
- let's see something generated from LF team and we iterate on that, instead of providing them more info

### Docfest before mini-summit
- it only makes sense if critical mass of implementers are present

### Making SPDX easier to use
- embrace complexity
- similar to JPEG
- not useful to try to dumb down spec to simple formatÂ 
- but provide tools that work with simpe input and generate full SPDX
- Gary notices that SPDX Lite has vocal supporters
- Alexios remarks that it's maybe a Lite Serialization, not spec
