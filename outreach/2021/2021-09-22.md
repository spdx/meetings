### SPDX Podcast

Joshua - infrastructure for publication is not entirely completed. Needs SPDX logo and other branding

Sebastian - command to pull individual links from RSS feed with [sfeed](https://codemadness.org/sfeed-simple-feed-parser.html): `curl -s https://spdx-official.libsyn.com/rss | sfeed | sfeed_plain | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f6`

Joshua - branding guidelines should be on the website - <https://github.com/spdx/outreach/issues/1>

Joshua - would like to set a time for recording the podcast every week, after polling the other hosts. Suggestion: twice a month late US Eastern Time and twice a month early US Eastern Time

Sebastian - can we post on Twitter for the podcast?

Joshua - we should use an 'auto-tweeter' - is this possible?

Vicky - yes; WordPress is easier but other solutions are possible

Joshua posted the various links for the podcast:

* Libsyn Classic Feed - <https://spdx-official.libsyn.com/rss>
* Podcast Page - <https://spdx-official.libsyn.com>
* Spotify - <https://spdx-official.libsyn.com/spotify>

Cecily Stewart üê± made an appearance

### Wikipedia page

Sebastian - still no proper editorial review after a month

Discussion of how to move forward. As other members have conflicts of interest as well, all agreed that Sebastian will make changes anyway with a note in talk.

### Fedora Magazine

Sebastian - Jilayne said in last Legal Team meeting that it would be best to hold off on publicising until Fedora Council have approved such a policy to use SPDX License Identifiers.

### Last Watchdog

<https://www.lastwatchdog.com> - asked for a 750 word article

Kate has drafted; Jennifer is working with the blog to get it sorted

### SPDX Membership

Kate - the form has been created for becoming a member of SPDX. Waiting for data backend to be made.

Vicky - can maybe provide logo immediately if company will be on inaugural members list

Joshua - I can also provide logos

All agreed to put logos on the top-level homepage of <https://spdx.dev>

Sebastian - what about KDE? They don't produce SBOMs, but they do use license identifiers

Kate - more discussion needed

Joshua - Pentoo maintainers will be likely to provide logo; will contact

Kate - landscape page contributions are also wanted: <https://github.com/spdx/outreach/issues/2>

### Keynote at LF conference

Kate will be doing keynote about securing supply chain at same time as meeting. Will not be able to attend next week's meeting.

### Outreach page on the website

Sebastian - Jack Manbeck recently updated the Outreach Team page on the SPDX website: <https://spdx.dev/participate/outreach/>
