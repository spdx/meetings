## Notes

**Approval of minutes from last meeting: minutes from SPDX Outreach Team meeting on 14th of July approved**

Kate - Interaction ongoing with GCC to introduce SPDX to the compiler-level of build processes

Joshua - Cyber Defence Matrix presentation shows a way of categorising types of threats and their mitigations: <https://cyberdefensematrix.com/>

### Landscape site

Kate introduced the SPDX Landscape site: <https://landscape.spdx.dev/>.

Kate - it would be good to populate this page with companies which have agreed to use SPDX for SBOMs

Joshua - the GitHub repository contains instructions for adding companies to the site and is looking to see if one of his team can do a scraping & populating.

### Wikipedia entry

Discussion of work to be done - requires rewriting most text. Existing page mostly focused on licensing with little reference to other use-cases. Only 'see-also' is for 'License Proliferation'.

Sebastian - we should ask to move the Wikipedia page from Software Package Data Exchange to SPDX due to potential of naming changes in the future (Bob's suggestion of 'Systems Package Data eXpression')

Sebastian - article on ZDNet might form good material for references: <https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-and-open-source-communities-rise-to-bidens-cybersecurity-challenge/>

Kate has a list of press releases by the Linux Foundation that would be relevant for the Wikipedia page.

## Topics for next meeting

* Conferences timeline and opportunities for SPDX-related presentations
