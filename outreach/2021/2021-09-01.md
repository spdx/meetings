## Notes

**Approval of minutes from last meeting: minutes from SPDX Outreach Team meeting on 25th of August approved**

### YouTube channel for podcast

Sebastian - Should we use the Linux Foundation's YouTube channel or create an SPDX channel?

Joshua - we could use both and release on SPDX first to incentivise new subscribers

### SPDX 3.0 development article

Discussion of preferred workflow to write article.

Nisha will write draft and share with Outreach Team at next meeting

Sebastian - there is concern within Outreach Team that users of SPDX will stop at SPDX 2.2. Hence useful to publicise 3.0 efforts

Discussion of new features to mention in article. Some topics are still controversial within Tech Team, but can be described with note that the specification is still in active development.

## Topics for next meeting

* Review SPDX 3.0 article draft
