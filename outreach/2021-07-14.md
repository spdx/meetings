Sebastian - Wikipedia has policies for writing articles when there may be a conflict of interest: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest#How_to_disclose_a_COI>

Kate will write a draft; Joshua to help with submission to Wikipedia

Sebastian - mailing list archives could be useful to cite

### Landscape of usage

Kate has a document of different companies using SBOMs and SPDX; will share privately with team

Discussion of [Automating Compliance Tooling (ACT)](https://automatecompliance.org). The FSFE's [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) could be a part of this; Kate and Sebastian to follow up with Max Mehl.

Kate - sorting of tooling into a list, whereby you have a taxonomy of fields, and then people can identify tools

Kate - is speaking soon about Zephyr with SBOMs

Joshua - has talks and panels lined up about supply chain risk - invitation for participation from members of the SPDX Outreach Team. Could be very popular in the industry. Ideas include: Emerging SPDX 3.0, SPDX Tools, Supply Chain Risk
