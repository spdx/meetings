* blog post on SPDX
  - from developer's view
  - SPDX is complicated, scares people away
  - easy steps on how to use the tools
  - SPDX also has verification features
  - we could publish a simpler JSON schema
  - we could publish a new version, unrelated (but interoperable)
  - there are critical business needs
  - may have simpler format, that can be automatically converted to full
