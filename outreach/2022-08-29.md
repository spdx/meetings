## Notes

### SPDX 2.3 blog post

Kate is waiting for PDF version of SPDX 2.3 before posting the article. No further progress on PDF since last Tuesday. Sebastian will try to override the layout to fix overflow, and if this isn't possible Kate will attempt to generate the PDF with a different method.

Conclusions:
    
    * Community page should have short blurb about the different teams, as well as information about the general meeting, mailing lists and chatrooms
    * Each Team should have a page under Community with links to its meeting minutes, meeting invitation and mailing list
    * About should have pages for Governance and Trademark policy, but not have 'using SPDX' and 'participate' pages (these will be part of Specifications and Community respectively).
    * Specifications page with boxes for each version rather than a table is better, but it should use 'tags' to express what kind of release it is. Each version should also include links to OWL descriptions and JSON schema.
