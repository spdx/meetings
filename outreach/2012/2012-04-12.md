## Minutes

  - SPDX Forum
      - Think the forum went really well -- good number of new folks
        especially on legal side
      - Gary O'Neall -- attracted large companies, bit
      - Really happy with volume and participation
      - Worked well to get new people involved.
      - Follow up
          - Kim to email to everyone that attended/registered as follow
            up
          - Send list of companies (not names) to spdx list and in
            follow up
          - save for invites for next year
          - send list to core team for access
          - need to post meeting times for each group on website and
            send agenda/reminder day before and include link
          - post notes from Kate onto web site
      - At General meeting -- need to discuss handling of emails - also
        discussion of users list
      - Might make sense for LF to add as a standard add-on day at
        Collab Summit or as a separate event
          - If needed could get a shuttle from SF hotel of collab summit
            to south bay
          - Still treat it as a separate event though and promote
            separately
          - Could it attach to LinuxCon events (evening)
          - May be better to be in Silicon Valley for a couple of years
  - Web site
      - Kirsten has completed home page for new site
      - Not sure about rest of site
      - Still a fair number of empty things in new hierarchy
      - Think Steve/Martin/Pierre are following up
      - Want to make sure that existing pages move over
  - Adoption
      - Communities
          - Outreach to communities follow up from
              - We target 4 possible communities
              - Kernel - Phil O to follow up with Jim Zemlin
              - Uboot - Kate and Jack to reach out
              - BusyBox - Mark G to reach out
              - Samba - Scott L to follow up. Scott has message in to
                Samba - Jeremey Allison
      - Companies
          - SPDX Forum was great for awareness, but need to figure out
            where to go from here.
          - How do we adapt into the corporate environment and mental
            model? Existing technical teams in companies have existing
            approach (like tied to SCM at Juniper) so how do you fit in
            to that - both technically and process wise?
          - Could we document process use cases and share them in
            whitepaper or preso on web site?
          - How do we work with a few early adopters and get them going
            and share their strategies?
          - Tech team is moving toward a migration path (vs tight
            backward compatibility)
      - Tools
          - Gary O'Neall is prototyping how to have hosted tools on web
            somewhere
          - There is a license matching prototype that Peter has posed
          - Ninka is working to produce SPDX
          - Scott Lamons working with U of Nebraska-Omaha to get
            Fossology up and running
              - Gary O Neall working with them as well
