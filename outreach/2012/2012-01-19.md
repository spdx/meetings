## Notes

  - Web site training
      - Steve Cropper and Pierre held a training session on moving stuff
        to the new site.
      - Kim took notes and will turn that into a how-to document and
        will send to everyone involved
  - Update on CC0 license
      - Kim sent email to Ian Skerrett at Eclipse, Robin Johnson at
        Gentoo, Spot at Fedora about the change in the data license from
        Public Data License to CC0
      - So far, I've hear back from Robin at Gentoo that he was happy
        about that. His email note said:
          - Looks good, 100% behind CC-0.
          - Tom: I meant to poke you re our idea of altering license
            naming in the distros to match SPDX license identifiers.
            We've been working on classifying all the licenses in
            Gentoo:
            <http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/profiles/license_groups?revision=1.102&view=markup>
            (the above only covers 252 out of the 614 licenses presently
            in Gentoo).
      - I sent a follow up to Robin asking if he would work with us to
        get the license list expanded to cover his 252 (or possibly 614)
        licenses in Gentoo.
  - Eclipse BOF
      - Chuck and Mahshad from Protecode are working to organize BOF at
        EclipseCon
      - I suggested that they should plan for no more than 20 people.
  - Software Supply Chain Summit
      - This would be a 1 day meeting in person with people involved in
        the software supply chain to discuss SPDX and OSS compliance in
        the supply chain
      - Targeting potentially April 6 (day after LF COllab Summit)
      - To be held in South Bay (possible at DLA or Cisco or HP
        facilities)
      - Topics would be about OSS compliance in the supply chain issues,
        SPDX issues and discussion
      - We want it to be not just presentation, but also discussion
      - We would target maybe 20 or so people from enterprises that
        use/distribute OSS
      - How to get people there
          - Current SPDX members to invite people
          - Mark Radcliffe will help market
          - Ask LF (Jim Z) to help
      - Kim to talk to LF to coordinate so we can finalize
        date/time/place
  - License List Process
      - We reviewed our previous notes for adding to license list and
        added a few more ideas and thoughts
      - Details at
        [Business\_Team/Process\_for\_Adding\_to\_License\_List\_Draft](Business_Team/Process_for_Adding_to_License_List_Draft "wikilink")
      - In general it looks pretty good, but we also need legal team to
        review and give feedback
      - Our goal is to have something in place by end of Q2, so we will
        start taking these notes and working it into a more formal
        description and a "to do" list of the pieces we need to put into
        place to make it happen.
  - Process for companies to adopt
      - We discussed how we move forward with company adoption.
      - Scott Lamons talked through their process
          - Can start with procurement team to ask suppliers to provide
            SPDX
          - Will need to educate procurement team on SPDX (what/why)
          - Will need places on website to point suppliers to
          - HP has a standard spreadsheet format for proposal tracking
            of all OSS requests -- but it's not the SPDX format.
          - HP would need to change to SPDX format
              - HP Would need to be able to have extra fields that are
                company specific and have the tools ignore/add those.
          - They Will need tools to help them
              - Scott's idea is that you feed it software repositories
                to scan for licenses and then you can input the SPDX
                specific fields and create SPDX files
              - We discussed the fact that ultimately you want to tie
                all of these pieces together, but in the short term,
                suppliers could use their current processes for figuring
                out what OSS they are using and then use the exisitng
                tools to convert to SPDX format.
          - HP Could also ask their developers that are making internal
            requests to provide SPDX
