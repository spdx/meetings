### Talking points

- 3 to 5 key talking points for "Ambassadors" of SPDX in vertical industry - e.g. Automotive, Critical Infrastructure

- proposed by Jordi:

In an era marked by an increased focus on transparency, security, and the rising complexity of software supply chains, the need for the adoption of Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is more urgent than ever. The regulatory landscape in both the United States and the European Union is rapidly evolving, signaling a clear move towards greater transparency in the software supply chain. This, coupled with the burgeoning complexity of software packages, makes it critical for organizations to ensure they have robust mechanisms in place for managing software components. Adopting SPDX SBOM format serves this need, enabling organizations to effectively respond to these shifts while enhancing their software management practices. Now, let’s dive into why SPDX is the right choice for your organization:

**1. Global Standardization and Accessibility:** SPDX is an international standard, freely available for anyone to use. This wide availability and acceptance make it a crucial tool for creating, maintaining, and sharing Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) across the globe. By standardizing the way we communicate data about software packages, SPDX helps to remove barriers, foster interoperability, and promote a common understanding among different software systems worldwide.

**2. Broad-Based Contributions and Reliability:** The SPDX project benefits from the contributions of a diverse community. These members come from different backgrounds, domains, and industries, which leads to a well-rounded and comprehensive standard that caters to a variety of verticals and use cases. The diverse input helps to ensure the robustness and reliability of SPDX, making it a trustworthy solution for managing software information.

**3. Active Development and Support:** The recent launch of the SPDX 3.0 release candidate exemplifies the vibrant and proactive community that maintains the standard. Not only is the standard continually updated to address new challenges and demands, but it also enjoys the backing of the Linux Foundation. This ongoing development and high-profile support ensure that SPDX remains a cutting-edge tool for software supply chain management.

**4. Rising Popularity of SBOMs:** Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) are becoming increasingly popular. Regulatory requirements and a general wave of interest in software supply chain transparency have made SBOMs a fundamental need in the software development and distribution process. SPDX provides a standardized way to create, share, and use SBOMs, making it a key player in this emerging landscape.

**5. Imperative for Integration:** Given the rising importance of SBOMs and the standardization provided by SPDX, it’s essential for businesses, open-source projects, and software tools to incorporate SPDX SBOM functionality. Adopting SPDX can improve interoperability, enhance transparency, ensure compliance with licensing terms, and bolster software supply chain security. In a world where software components often come from numerous sources, using SPDX can be a critical part of responsible software development and use.


- Feeback
 - Add specifics for the vertical - for energy, the regulatory space - pick a couple of specifics
 - Mention ISO in point 1 - keep freely available
 - freely available -> available at no cost to obtain and use
 - Support a wide variety of use cases - add more specifics, AI, Datasets - add another point?  Will try adding the use cases into point 2.
 - point 3: "ensure" -> "ensures". Add "more than 10 years". Also mention "software" being produced.
