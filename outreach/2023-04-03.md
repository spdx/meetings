## Attendees

* Alexios Zavras
* Jack Manbeck
* Phil Odence
* Maximilian Huber
* Sebastian Crane

## Notes

Discussion of the meeting time; will change meeting time to suit new SPDX Outreach Team Leads and interested community members.

Discussion of the outstanding topics from last meeting. Both the Outreach Team charter and the ecosystem picture are considered finished from the perspective of the Outreach Team, and are awaiting feedback from the Steering Committee members.

Discussion on hosting for the rebuilt SPDX website. Amazon Web Services is looking like a likely option, as it is already used for the SPDX License List and SPDX Online Tools. It was noted that there are difficulties with group access to AWS resources, so seeking funding for a teams plan with a hosting provider may be appropriate.
