## Notes

GSOC applications for organisations opening. Alexios can do the administration of this, but is requesting mentors and soliciting project ideas. It is asked whether a single project can be hosted by two different GSOC organisations; Alexios informed that this is not possible, but organisations can collaborate informally nonetheless.
