## Attendees:

  - Pierre, LaPointe
  - Kirsten Newcomer

## Discussion

Initial focus is on reworking the Home page for spdx.org; we'll tackle
other pages after that. Discussion points covered items such as format,
navigation, work group wiki pages, and analytics.

## Format & Navigation

The <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/> home page provides a possible
model we might want to follow.

There are at least 3 major categories that need to be easy to access
from the home page:

  - Participate
  - Beta
  - Learn/Use -- not clear yet whether this should be category or two

We might use the kind of format shown on linuxfoundation.org for "Attend
a Linux Event," "Enroll in Linux Training," and "Read a Publication."

Having drop downs for the links across the top of the page (as is done
on linuxfoundation.org) would help to provide additional info as to
what's available on those pages so that users don't have to navigate
there first to figure out what's available.

The contents of the blue bar at the bottom of spdx.org should use larger
fonts and might also have more links to help folks find more items.

The navigation links that appear on the right hand side should be moved
to the left (assuming we decide to keep them)

## Work group wiki pages

Working group wiki pages: We will reach out to the leads for each
working group and ask them to gather feedback from their groups as to:

  - Most relevant/used areas
  - What parts of the current structure works well for their working
    group
  - What parts could be better organized
  - Is it time to group some of the existing links for easier navigation

## Analytics

It would be helpful to have analytics on use/page visits of the existing
spdx.org web pages
