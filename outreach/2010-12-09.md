## Thoughts for Beta Program (for discussion)

**Beta program**

  - Start with RC1 (Q1 sometime?)
  - Need spec and license list available. PO - asked could we get
    started with license list incomplete?
  - Ideally 3-5 trading partner pairs (assuming some will not complete
    it)
  - They agree to designate at least one project where one partner will
    create an SPDX file and the other partner will receive and review it
  - (they could do this in parallel with a “spreadsheet process”)
  - They provide feedback on what worked, what didn’t, issues, questions
  - SPDX group will provide support – available for ad-hoc and regular
    calls on technical or other issues
  - Time period – feedback by Jun
  - Want people willing to be quoted in announcement
  - Try to get mix of use cases if possible (ex HP HW supplier and Linux
    distro, Mobile supply chain, Linux distro/upstream projects,
    consumer and supplier sides of supply chain)
