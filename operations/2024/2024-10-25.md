    - https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser for verification
- Input from Ummo: In the OpenChain Webinar: ['SBOM Visualization - An Alternative Approach to Reviewing SBOMs'](https://openchainproject.org/news/2024/10/01/coming-soon-webinar-on-sbom-visualization) there was a note in the discussion, that CycloneDx has an active discussion, whether to include patent informartion. Since we touched on that earlier, we should maybe revisit the topic and link the discussion with CycloneDx.
