## Attendees
- Matthew Crawford
- Ummo Schwarting
- Victor Lu
- Alfred Strauch
- Steven Carbno

## Notes
- Business operations vs. technical operations: technical operations representations efforts for SPDX should not impeded business operations implementation.
- Business operations will  focus on representing assessments in form of assessment relationships.
- If possible, a way to link assessments to source data in technical specifications inside the SPDX document should be implemented.
- SPDX Core provides mechsnism to track data changes/amendments, this should allow to have persistent links to source objects.
