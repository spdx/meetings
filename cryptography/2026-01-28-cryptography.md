## MoM

### News

Agustin
* I am at the Software Heritage Symosium. 
* Pinged Alexios to get our mom merge on a regular basis. He is ooo until Feb 9th
* Invited [Stefan-Lucas Gazdag](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-lukas-gazdag-5a30b67a/) to join one of our meetings. He will join us on Feb 11th
* Added references to a couple of [more algorithms](https://github.com/spdx/cryptographic-algorithm-list/issues/9#issuecomment-3749348341). Still a few to go for asecond batch. 

### AOB

Steven
* Deterministic random bits generators might be a good category to record because it will be needed by different profile.

### Text to describe the List

The following text will be added to the SPDX website.
We need to think about the publishing of the ist at the SPDX website. 
* The Group will work on this topic during next meeting `Agreed`

#### SPDX Cryptographic Algorithm List 

Modeled after the [SPDX License List](https://github.com/spdx/cryptographic-algorithm-list), this list provides a shared and unambiguous vocabulary for identifying and referencing cryptographic algorithms in Bills of Materials (BOM), SPDX documents, and related tooling. 

The SPDX Cryptographic Algorithm List includes a standardized short identifier, the full name, OID, cryptoClass, and references. 

The purpose of the SPDX Cryptographic Algorithm List is to enable efficient and reliable identification of Cryptographic Algorithms in an SPDX document, in source files or elsewhere.

* Add a ticket to the spdx website with this text `ToDo`
* How do we want the list to be published on the website? `Question`
   * Can we reuse what the licesne list did? `Question`
