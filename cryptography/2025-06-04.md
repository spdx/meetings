## Agenda

- parameters of algorithms
- categorization

## Notes

- parameters
    - mode has to be different algorithm
    - key size  a parameter to a single algorithm
    - use cases might not need key size
    - Augustin notes that key size might affect export control
      - to be investigated more
    - use key *size* not strength
- categorization
    - for example: hashing, signing, etc.
    - NIST has classes: hash, symmetric key, asymmetric key
- for next week
  - try to populate the three lists, to see whether segmentation makes sense
  - also add mode
