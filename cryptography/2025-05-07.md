# SPDX Cryptography Meeting 2025-05-07

- Alexios Zavras
- Agustin Benito Bethencourt
- Alfred L Strauch
- Bob Martin
- Jerónimo Ortiz
- Quique Goñi
- Steven Carbno

## Agenda

- Introduction
- Cryptographic Algorithms List
    - What attributes should there be for each entry?
- Information related to Cryptography that should be included in a BOM
    - What information?
    - How to include such information? (updates on the SPDXv3 model)

## Notes

Alexios explains that the goal is that this list becomes something similar to the SPDX list. He provides some background on how the SPDX License list started.

This is a pure list of data, algorithms.

The second goal is to provide crypto algorithms related info that should be added to SPDX. Use cases: security and export control

Current crypto algorithm list as starting point: https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/tree/main

We need to put focus on the use cases to understand the info we need to add to the list.

Meetings
- Weekly at this time
   - Both goals will be covered on every meeting at first
   - No agenda specific meetings

Any other efforts
- We will need to sync up with other efforts or initiatives trying to model cryptographic information. Let's start collecting this.

For next call:
- collect info on other efforts/initiatives
- explain the current state of the list
