# SPDX Cryptography Meeting 2025-06-11

- Alexios Zavras
- Alfred L Strauch
- Agustin Benito Bethencourt
- Quique Go√±i
- Steven Carbno

## Agenda

* Algorithm categorization
* Alexios have a conflict with this meeting

## Notes

* Alexios explains his conflict
   * Agustin takes over the "chair" role
* Discussion about the output provided by Quique
   * Link to ticket: https://github.com/spdx/crypto-algorithms/issues/11#issuecomment-2960696021
   * We all like it. A few algorithms from the list missing. Quique will add them at the end and will keep trying to categorise them.
   * This exercise tried to answer the question, does applying the NIST catergorization makes sense for the list. General consensus that, seeing the results, it does.
* Steven propose to create another list for things like TLS (correct?). We will end up with more than one list because each one will require different attribute
   * Discussion about having different lists vs having a single one and adding categories.
   * No objections nor strong support.
* Discussing about how we can improve the current list based on what Quique did.
   * Consensus on trying to capture the information provided by Quique into the list.
   * Agustin will create a PR adding the info with the category attribute and Note attribute
* Agustin is working on adding a reference for each algorithm with the description of each one of them. It might take some time
