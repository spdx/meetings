# SPDX Serialization Meeting 2024-02-22

## Attendees
- Gary O'Neall
- Joshua Watt
- Nisha Kumar
- Victor Lu

## Agenda
- Do we need a simple JSON serialization schema?

## Notes
- Update on tag-value: LF's safety profile group is trying to make a strict-docs (ties documents to code) for SPDX. strict-docs is based on "requirements driven development". This _could_ replace tag-value.
- Discussion on whether you need a context
  - Useful for expanding IRI's, but not required
  - If we have a simple JSON, you won't have the IRI expansion anyway
  - Conclusion: If you're not interested in the full IRI's, e.g. a simple JSON format, you can just ignore the @context
  - However, you do need to include the static @context line when writing JSON file
  - Note: @context is static and doesn't change for a given version of SPDX spec
- Joshua created a JSON schema for the current JSON-LD serialization: https://github.com/JPEWdev/shacl2code/blob/context/tests/expect/jsonschema/spdx3-context.json

## Decisions
- Cononical serializations will be a strict subset of JSON-LD
- We will create a JSON schema which will enforce the subset to the extent possible
