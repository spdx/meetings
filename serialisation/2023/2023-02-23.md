# SPDX Serialisation Meeting 2023-02-23

## Attendees

* Armin TÃ¤nzer
* Marc-Etienne Vargenau
* Maximilian Huber
* Sebastian Crane

## Notes

Sebastian introduced this series of meetings and outlined the approach of enumerating the stakeholders of SPDX serialisation and their desired use-cases and features. Discussion yielded the following potential qualities of serialisation formats:

* Human readability
* Machine readability (rigorously defined and validatable)
* Deterministic (canonical) representation
* Completeness (full coverage of the SPDX model)
* Conciseness

Discussion of CBOR and whether to support this as a SPDX serialisation format. It is asked whether JSON can be translated to CBOR in a one-to-one fashion, since CBOR is based on the JSON data model. It was decided to postpone this discussion until David Kemp is present.

Discussion of TOML, and whether this is a suitable choice for human readability.

Discussion of whether spreadsheets of SPDX data are machine-readable and to what extent they are being used in the SPDX community.

General sentiment of those present is that tag-value should be replaced with another, JSON-compatible, serialisation format which has the qualities of tag-value that must be preserved. Furthermore, it is felt that JSON should be a common base for all serialisation formats.

Is it noted that JSON-LD is often not easy to parse with a non-RDF JSON parser.
