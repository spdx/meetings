  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/376
* discussion regarding a simplified version:
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/396

## Notes
* summary of last weeks tech team meeting
* Serlialization Examples Repo
  * NK:
    * create examples, and describe them. And others can propose serializaiton examples
  * DK:
    * like a serialization playground
  * GO'N:
    * if someone writes a readme, we have a name and a list of codeowners, I can spin that up
  * MH:
      * we should do a depth first approach, and should try to have some complexity instead of listing all base cases
  * GO'N:
      * maybe start with https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/tree/development/v2.3.1/examples
  * DK:
      * I propose to have a table of contents to compare multiple serializations of the same accross each other
  * NK:
      * Proposed structure
        * README
        * model/
        * serialization/
          * format1/
          * format2/
        * tests
  * NK:
    * suggested to use the https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/ instead of a new playground repository
      * GO'N:
         * I think we still need the playground
* NK: Rahul was introduced, he is a GsoC intern, contributing to the parsers in the spdx-sbom-tool
    
## Decision:
* we will create a "prototype-3.0" branch in the spdx-examples repo and it is free for others to contribute proposed serializations
* we (Gary) will create a spdx-3-serialization-prototype-playground
  * Maintainers: Nisha, Max, David

## TODOs:
* NK: I will create the README 
* GO'N: create the repository
* NK: I plan to rework spdx-examples repo to support SPDX3 and that can be used as playground
