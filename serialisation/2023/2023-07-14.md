## Notes

### PR #377
- General issue: how to handle string with pattern restrictions: new types or property restrictions? (SemVer, DateTime, MediaType)
- DateTime is used multiple places, SemVer maybe once.
- Should every restricted string be a Class regardless of whether it is used once or multiples?
- Dave: better to have types for every use
- How would that be expressed in RDF?
- Gary: 1. SHACL pattern restriction at property; 2. XML-schema type definition and validation 
- Datatypes (literals) vs "classes"
- Re-use types from xsd
- update the spec parser to generate the restrictions to property
- output is SHACL pattern restriction at property
- Decision: new directory "Datatypes" to have these definitions 
- explore how to preserve "datatype" for going to the reverse direction (e.g. markdown files, JSON schema)
- we can define the datatype in OWL; pattern restriction can be an annotation, at worst
- it should be used in every case
- deferred for later discussion: DateTime modeled as integer Unix time, string representations defined in serialization

### MediaType
- also the same problem
- pattern is string "/" string
- even better, if we want: first string one of the 10 registries - DavidK to propose regex


### Custom Licenses in expressions
- Issue #380
- how can one use LicenseRef-xxx in an expression?  CustomLicenses (and CustomAdditions) have URIs, not short names
- proposal to add a Map to LicenseExpression as an additional property, mapping short names to objects
