## Notes

Sean presented a deck of slides that he and Alexios had created to explain concepts relating to JSON-LD and RDF with regard to SPDX. The presentation convered JSON, JSON-LD, context maps and ontologies.

Those present agreed that Tag-Value should be replaced with a more structured format based on existing standards. Maximilian asked it to be noted that he believes that a specifically human-readable format would be unneccessary once the JSON format is defined, and that Tag-Value should be removed.
