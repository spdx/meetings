# SPDX Serialisation Meeting 2023-04-06

## Attendees

* Alexios Zavras
* Armin TÃ¤nzer
* Sebastian Crane
* Maximilian Huber

## Notes

Discussions of Armin's JSON-LD example from the mailing list. The SPDX JSON-LD full context map would not be included in each SPDX document; it would be referred to by URI instead.

The values of enumerated properties like packagePurpose would be URIs, since JSON-LD doesn't support the context abbreviations as values.

Discussion of dates in SPDX JSON-LD; date times are currently specified as xsd:dateTime in the model repository.
