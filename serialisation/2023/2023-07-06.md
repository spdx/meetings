## Agenda
- Duplicate property names (in different profiles)
- JSON-LD context shorthands
- Serialization formats

## Notes

- Duplicate property names (in different profiles)
  - JSON-LD context shorthands
  - current example: "locator" both in core and security
  - DECISION: if not unique, name has to be qualified (e.g. "core:locator" and "security:locator")

- JSON-LD context shorthands
  - Discussion on whether shorthands of "profile:property" to "property" should even be there
  - mention that context will be versioned
    - e.g. http://spdx.org/rdf/v3/context.json  vs   http://spdx.org/rdf/v3.1/context.json

- Serialization formats
  - we have said that we want to support multiple serialization formats
  - RDF definitely
  - JSON can be done in multiple ways
    - JSON-LD-as-JSON
    - simple JSON
  - other formats, possibly including a very simple printf-generated
- Next meeting, we'll focus on a decision of the JSON-LD format can be a more general JSON format or if we need a second JSON format
  - If we decide we need a second format, we will document the issues with the JSON-LD
  - If we decide we need a second format, we will review David's proposal and decide if it meets the needs for a second JSON format or document the issues preventing it from being accepted
