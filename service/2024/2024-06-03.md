# SPDX Software as a Service Meeting 2024-06-03 

## Attendees
- Gary O'Neall
- David Edelson
- Prasad Iyer

## Agenda
- use case: #9: Trust the identity of the service provider (authentication) - confirm this is now in the model software-service branch
- use case #1: Is the service vulnerable due to a software vulnerability discovered in a component used directly by the service provider.
- use case #11: Understand if any services host user data in a geographic region which violates export control regulations
- use case #3: Provide information about the platform the service is hosted on (Eg: whether it is using a marketplace or a plain cloud service)
- use case #10: Trust that data transmission is encrypted / protect
- Decide if we want to include any of the optional use cases for 3.1 (use cases 5, 7, 8, 15)

## Minutes
- Discussed certificate validation
- Two scenarios:
  1. Service provider provides a service to the consumer
  2. Service provider is a client to another external to the service provier service
- For 1 - the X.509 certificate is all the information the service provider needs to provide.  The X.509 cert has the issuing authority.  The issuing authority determines what type of validation is available and the consumer determines which mechanisms are actually used.
- For 2 - We may want / need to capture which validation methods are being used to provide information on how secure the connection is between the service provider their provider which is external to the service provider
- Question: Do we want to model the CA and what validation services it provides?
- Agreed that external reference approach for X.509 should work - we just need a volunteer to implement a PR
