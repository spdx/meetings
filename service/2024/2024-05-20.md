# SPDX Software as a Service Meeting 2024-05-20

## Attendees
- Gary O'Neall
- Nisha Kumar

## Agenda
- use case: #9: Trust the identity of the service provider (authentication) - confirm this is now in the model software-service branch
- use case #1: Is the service vulnerable due to a software vulnerability discovered in a component used directly by the service provider.
- use case #11: Understand if any services host user data in a geographic region which violates export control regulations
- use case #3: Provide information about the platform the service is hosted on (Eg: whether it is using a marketplace or a plain cloud service)
- use case #10: Trust that data transmission is encrypted / protect
- Decide if we want to include any of the optional use cases for 3.1 (use cases 5, 7, 8, 15)

- Last meeting's discussion resulted in a recommendation to add either the X509 certificate from the service profile or a reference to an X509 certification
- Discussed reference vs direct data
  - direct data is rather complex - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509 - would be a lot of effort to duplicate in our model
  - suggestion to add an external reference to the X509
  - we could add a new external reference type for X509
  - PR would be welcome
  - Discussed whether ExternalRef or ExternalIdentifier - seem to be more appropriate for an ExternalRef since it does not uniquely identify the service provider element
  - Add an externalRefType for 509
  - locator: string representing the location - possibly a URL?
  - medial type: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/x-x509-ca-cert
- Use case 1 - 
  - A lot of the data is already there in SBOMs and security profile
  - Could just use the existing VulnAssessmentRelationship and associated it with the Service which is an Element - so no changes really needed
  - the only action may be to write up how to use the existing spec
- Use case 11: should coordinate with Mathew and the operations profile - they are defining geographic restrictions for software deployment
