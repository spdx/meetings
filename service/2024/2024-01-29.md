# SPDX Software as a Service Profile Team Meeting 2024-01-29

## Attendees
* Gary O'Neall
* Nisha Kumar
* Prasad Iyer

## Agenda
* Decide on how we want to tackle the development of the spec
  * Start with ACME example pattern?
  * Start with class / property definitions?
* Start with one of highest priority use cases:
    * Find out if a service is using any other services
    * Trust the identity of the service provider (authentication) 

## Notes

### Plan of attack
* Start with the top priority use case
* List steps
* Create a Service branch in the model
* Start modeling with the top priority use case then move on to the next highest priority

### Use case 14 - Find out if a service is using any other services
* Created the profile.md page
* Created a ServiceProvider as a subclass of agent
  * Discussed alternatives - subclass of Organization, subclass of Element - decided on a subclass of Agent directly
* ServiceProvider has one additional property providerUrl
  * Decided it needed to be a URL, but did not need to be public - could be private
  * Used as an identifier and as a location hinkt
