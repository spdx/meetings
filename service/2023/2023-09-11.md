## Agenda
* Profile document update

## Notes
* Discussion on formats used for Cloud Market Place standard
  * Google is using a custom format - Google OSPO "standard"
  * Would the format be different if it is an API for a service?
    * There will be differences - there are license compliance differences
* Agree that the scope for the service profile is between the service provider of the actual service and not the marketplace "thin client" that may be downloaded
  * Reference to a download terms: https://cloud.google.com/terms/marketplace/launcher
  * Reference to a marketplace terms: https://cloud.google.com/terms/marketplace-open-source-terms
* Updated use case document with discussion on market places
* Note: "legal entity" sounds like a good name for "ownership"
* Started discussing trust use cases and the importance of providing the information
* Need to define "why" we need the use cases supported

## Decisions
* Agree that the scope for the service profile is between the service provider of the actual service and not the marketplace "thin client" that may be downloaded

* Start prioritizing the use cases - everyone pick High, Medium, Low - High could be interpreted as must, but it is more of a prioritizing.
