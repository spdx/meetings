* Nisha - to move the folder over
* Went through the comments in the use case document - resolved some of the issues
* Agreed to continue to ask "does this need the service profile or can it be supported by other SPDX profiles without using the service profile?" as we dig into the use cases
* We will try to resolve some of the remaining comments before the next call

## Decisions
* We will vote on the use cases based on the information available in the use case documents.  If anyone feels that a use case should be a high priority and it has outstanding comments, or incomplete information, they are encouraged to fill that information in before the next meeting.

## Action Items
* Review and contribute to the outstanding comments in the use case document before the next call
* Add your votes on the priority and effort columns in the spreadsheet before the next call
