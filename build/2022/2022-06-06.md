# SPDX Build meeting = June 6, 2022

## Agenda

- Discuss Roadmap
- Define a proposal of Provider/Service construct (Nisha, et. al)
- Defining the contents of the build profile (5 W's of a build)

## Attendees

- Brandon Lum
- Stephen Provine
- Nisha Kumar
- Sebastian Crane
- David Edelson

## Notes

- Talking through build document from Nisha
  - Addressing comments from Tony on Blaze/bazel, seems like we are okay with meeting the requirements on current discussion/proposal
  - Nisha: Is services/providers able to sufficiently be respresented in Core?
  - Consider the Make system, do we want to describe the configuration of that make system? Do we want to describe any arguments in the make system
  - This will be covered by config info
- What should provider looks like?
  - Maybe a relationship  - PROVIDER_OF?
  - Example: This build system was invoked in envronment X by provider Y
  - Local build: computer and you install the build toolchain make on your machine and invoke make install
    - Toolchain itself (SPDX Package) - HOW
    - Source code (SPDX Package) - HOW
    - Build Invoker - human operator (Identity - SPDX 3.0) - HOW
    - Computer (Provider? - does it need to contain what's inside it?) - WHERE
    - Invocation (ConfigInfo?) - HOW/WHEN
    - Provider has identity and it has optional relationships to what it contains (e.g. its running environment)
      - Service Element
        - Collection of packages and configuration
        - architecture, behavior programmed by provider (firewall, etc.)
        - Has relationship to/from:
          - provider , iether identity or identifier of an identity
          - software pacakges installed or available (optional)

    - WHERE
          *Build Image of the execution environment (VM/Container), including integrity information (hash)
          * This should be a pointer to a "file"?  or another package?
          * Can be a provider or service
    - Continue disucssion on following bullets:
    - HOW Build Invocation
      - Build Inputs
        - Build request information, etc.
        - Initatior of build (part of the HOW) (also indentity)
        - [build images] New relationship "BUILT WITH" SPDX Package (which may include services)??
        - Build image - this needs to be clarified, is it the build infrastructure?
          - Package for defining this - can be a container image, VM images, github action (could be service as well)
          - How far do we define this - currently just generic metadata and useful within its own specific context.
        - Build Entrypoint Script (moved from the WHERE section) (part of configinfo)
        - Parameters/Environment variables (part of configinfo)
      - Source Input
        - Source code
        - Packages/dependencies
      - [Optional] Builder Invocation Metadata - need more examples here.   Not completely sure what this means.
      - [Optional] Build Invoker - is the "Button Pusher" - ie. the entity that "Invoked" the build.  other ideas, conjurer, actuator or trigger.

    - WHEN
      - Time of build (start/completion)  - this is just 2 timestamps (and align with timestamp in rest of spec)
      - [Optional] Log references - multiple,  link to file.
      - Parameters/Environment variables (part of configinfo) - evaluated references/env variables

    - WHAT Output
      - Artifact - output of the build.   Pointer to file.   There may be multiple outputs from one build.
        - Concern is describing self?   Would this be same as what the SBOM has the build info inside it.
        - Probably a good area to write up examples, and see if we can take it from there.
        - Nisha is looking mostly at services at this point.   Kate is looking at embedded/cross compiles, etc.
      - SBOM - this should be a relationship to a file (possibly set of files when multiple aftifact outputs from build).  "DOCUMENT" may work here if needed.

SPDX Build Profile Roadmap (Draft)

- [10 June] Define a proposal of Provider/Service construct (Nisha, et. al)
- [17 June] Defining the contents of the build profile (5 W's of a build)
- [24 June] Define a proposal of ConfigInfo (Gary, et. al)
- [15 July] Define additional SPDX relationships and how to express the build profile

- backporting - what are thoughts on this and how it would fit use cases and model
- configuration info - an object on its own? what should they include - what other usecases? - Gary + build profile team
  - Environment - an object on its own? (Discuss for consensus) - bring to SPDX tech group
  - Environment variables OR parameters OR command/entrypoint
  - Related to build element?
  - Options
    - SPDX 3.0 Build element
    - ConfigInfo element type
    - SPDX properties
- Provider = (Provider SBOM - service SBOM?) - Nisha to draft topic of discussion here for main tech group
- Roadmap [Brandon to write - team things we can target June]
