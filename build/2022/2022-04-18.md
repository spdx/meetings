## Agenda

* Action Items
  * Create build profile discussion calendar / make working group? How to link other folks to the group
* Continue discussion on Build Profile use cases and ideas
* Survey Reproducible Builds & SLSA build info (<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D4L4u-YXABMHPYEukE4HiBzslsKoDKueNNIbj6lDA5o/edit?resourcekey=0-gmG-nkb9ykFNsndBSacE2w>)

## Notes

* Are we focusing on 2.3 or 3.0
  * Nisha: There are somethings that can probability go into 2.3, most of these requirements can fit into 3.0
  * +1 by William, Sebastian and Bob
* To follow up with Thomas on getting calendar up
* Reproducible builds and SLSA comparison
  * Overall feel - repro builds also contains materials going into the build and output hases explicitly encoded before the build
  * Describing the environment of the build
  * SLSA mostly describes "who" builds it
  * Reprobuilds mostly around debian - you need to look at source packages
  * Reprobuilds can produce attestations based on buildinfo file
  * Sebastian: is the SLSA provenance generation a PoC? Brandon: yes
  * SLSA has some metadata about completeness.
  * Sebastian: where would this kind of data fit into SPDX? Perhaps SPDX can link to these files?
    * Brandon: perhaps express this through relationships.
  * William: If we were to represent this in an SPDX document, there could be an element for build and relationships for input and output. Buildinfo element would have info about the environment, parameters
  * Sebastian: a build may also produce SPDX elements "files". William: inputs and outputs are packages.
  * Bob: packages or contextual collections? William: because they are an output from a build they could be a distributable thing.
  * Sebastian suggests diagramming.
  * Build profile would be its own group, could see an argument to put it in software profile, but depends on how commonly it's used. Risk in putting it in software profile is that people may not support it since it doesn't cover what they may want to do.
  * Package has zero or more inputs
  * SPDX packages can contain files/packages
  * Having a package of .deb archive may be missing contextual information about where it is pushed
  * We will need to have multiple outputs (usecase of uploading to different. archives, artifacts URI on each artifact element)
  * non-zero outputs? Not clear if there's a usecase for zero outputs, but decision to put it in first and remove unless people misuse. If build context is important by itself there coule be a "build" element with no outputs. Also temporrily of SPDX element creation - build may precede contents.
  * Build provenance information would be in its own document
  * How do we relat the artifacts to the SPDX documents and build SPDX documents
  * Ouputs will be artifact, output will have hash information so there will be a binding to the build
  * Github Actions case, everything is done, it just creates a standalone document
  * Tricky is when you try to create a single document that emcompass everything including the output of the build. How do i capture that the build produces the SPDX document, if I don't know what the detaiils of that document are yet to be determined at time of creation of the SPDX document.
  * William: I think this largely depends on when and how each of the artifacts is generated and I expect that will vary based on your SDLC processes.
