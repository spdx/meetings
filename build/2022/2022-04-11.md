## Notes

### Scope brainstorming

* Build on Reproducible Builds (<https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/recording/>)
* Build on SLSA provenance as a reference: <https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2>
* Platform, env variables, network requirements
* NIST SSDF
* Interesting pointers for YOCTO to capture host tools
* Attestation of the build server's integrity and security
* Toolchain inclusion, arguments and options
* Watermark: Build provenance information inside the build itself
* Environment Variable capture.
* Challenge is which tools and variable affect a build.
* Differences in definitions of build system elements.   Encoding.
* How can we capture things we can make policy statements about?   To let folks inform decision choices?
* Use cases!!!
* Know window of compromise on a build environment during a time window.

* Want to separate between "Builder Compomise" vs "Toolchain Software compromise".
* Sofware on laptop compomised vs.  checkout from github on repo vs. ...  where put trust that it's what in the repo.   Artifact actually matches what is in the repo.

### Element describes a build context that others can refer to it

* Build environment at a point in time.    Whole machine or container.
* <https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/perimeter/> let's not reinvent
* <https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2#fields> is a reasonable starting point.
* Should we look at pointing to SLSA doc?   Distribution server problem?   Standardize in SPDX?

* Some concensus - enable to link out to specific documents as a first step.
* Build up from outlinks, figure out what's needed for policy data, and how we should query.
* Defects is focusing on separating on identifier(who) and pointer to defect info (SECURITY)  as external reference.

* SLSA may contain multiple build.   Decomposition - on build action refers to a set of artifacts.    Could be multiple SLSA documents to a single executable.    Link to document via URL on web.  Identified with a URL, but verified with a hash.   All intoto doc's put in transparency log, and reference with transparency log id.   Extra layer?

* What about hash of one of these external files?   Yes,  would expect to see.

* Verification of links/external references...  handled by core.   Verified is probably mandatory here.
* This profile will live/die by integrity of the things it uses.
* Challenge are there some portions of SLSA that need to be verified (digests).
* Note this is going to be useful for license compliance in future as well.  Find the source files, and able to extrapolate forward.
* <https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/BuildinfoFiles>

* AI:  Brandon to survey both Reproducible Builds & SLSA build info, and provide a table comparing.

* Sebastian:  Is there something in SPIFFE we should be looking at?   Brandon:  scoped to a trust domain level.   Should there be another level of trust - tieing to platform vs. organization.   Possible to create a "fake" SPIFFE?   It helps express more evidence.   Intoto specification for SPIFFE ids.

* Note:  Identity of builder - check that 3.0 core will support.

* Brandon volunteers to lead this group.
  * Sebastian and Kate willing to lend a hand.

* Dimension to cover:
  * look at SLSA framework
  * linkage
  * environment
  * attestation and accreditation
  * tools, versions, options on tools.
  * memory safe operations, canary operations, ... etc.   Only can be collected at point of build
