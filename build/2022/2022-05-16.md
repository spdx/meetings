# SPDX Build meeting = May 16, 2022

## Attendees

* Kate Stewart
* David Edelsohn
* Sebastian Crane
* Nisha Kumar
* Bob Martin

## Agenda

* Review Draft Build Profile Elements - coherent?  make sense?
* WHO Builder (which service/organization built it)
  * Kate: Can we use <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/package-information/#76-package-originator-field>?
  * Nisha:  Provider - person that pushed the button on web site,  or the provider itself, or another entity that provider is outsourcing to.   ie.   There is github actions, two entities collaborating to build.   Person - Nisha,  and the other entity is Github.    Another example would be using CircleCI, but hosted on github.   Push button on website, that uses a build runner.    Is it,  who owns the build machines, scripts, etc.
  * Nisha: Brandon's survey document Buildinfo & SLSA.   SLSA - it's the provider (github),  in Buildinfo, it's the machine.
  * Sebastian,  is this a corner cases?   Consider IBM's Kubernetes based CI service.   Tekton.
  * Kate: Another examples is SUSE's public build framework.  <https://build.opensuse.org/>
  * Nisha:  Other case,  Heroku? (open source specification for building, but implementation is in house).
  * Sebastian:  A good way to start may be to use a package element for the software that runs the build.   Don't think we need a new properties.
  * Nisha: Should we make a distinction between the entity that pushed the button and the entity that owns the build infrastructure.
  * Conclusion:  Builder (could be called Operator or Service or Provider) is the entity that OWNS the infrastructure, used to do the build
  * It would be optional to make a relationship between the Builder and the Package which the builder runs to do the build.
  * The Package Originator needs to be refined in 3.0.   We need to clarify these roles.

* WHERE Build Infrastructure (Builder Orchestration - reused infrastructure of the builder)
  * Build Image of the execution environment (VM/Container), including integrity information (hash)
    * This should be a pointer to a "file"?  or another package?   Top level environment only makes sense.
    * Nisha:  We've been looking at 3 types:  Container, VM, and host.
  * Build Entrypoint script: Path to execute the build in build image.
    * Pointer to a file or package?
    * Nisha:  Should this be Build Invocation rather than Build infrastructure?  **Brandon - thoughts?**
      * Brandon: i think there are 2 entrypoints, the entrypoint for the builder and the entrypoint for the build, i think the builder entrypoint is in this section and the build entrypoint lives in build invacation.
  * Sebastian:  Should this also contain environment variables?   This is a running state aspect.

* HOW Build Invocation
  * Build Inputs
    * Build request information, etc.
    * Parameters
    * Build image - this needs to be clarified, is it the build infrastructure?
    * Build Entrypoint Script (moved from the WHERE section)

  * Source Input
    * Source code
    * Packages/dependencies
  * [Optional] Builder Invocation Metadata - need more examples here.   Not completely sure what this means.
  * [Optional] Build Invoker - is the "Button Pusher" - ie. the entity that "Invoked" the build.  other ideas, conjurer, actuator or trigger.

* WHEN
  * Time of build (start/completion)  - this is just 2 timestamps (and align with timestamp in rest of spec)
  * [Optional] Log references - multiple,  link to file.

* WHAT Output
  * Artifact - output of the build.   Pointer to file.   There may be multiple outputs from one build.
    * Concern is describing self?   Would this be same as what the SBOM has the build info inside it.
    * Probably a good area to write up examples, and see if we can take it from there.
    * Nisha is looking mostly at servi at this point.   Kate is looking at embedded/cross compiles, etc.
  * SBOM - this should be a relationship to a file (possibly set of files when multiple aftifact outputs from build).  "DOCUMENT" may work here if needed.

Other notes:

* Turtle all the way down.
* Know your ingredients - use free software.
* All the special sauces of "business value" and make transparent.
* Attestation/opinion of what you're running.

Follow ups:

* AI:  Kate to ask Gary to join next week.
* AI: Nisha to work on some examples.
