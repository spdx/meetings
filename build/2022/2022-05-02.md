# SPDX Build meeting = May 2, 2022

## Attendees

* Brandon Lum
* Bob Martin
* Nisha Kumar
* Kate Stewart
* Sebastian Crane
* Jeff Schutt

## Agenda

* Backports
* Envrionment vs provider (define clarity around these)
* Continue discussion of data model of Build, and its inputs/outputs, address the issue of generation of the SPDX document as part of the build itself (issue of writing metadata to describe itself), and how to abstract away or provide guidance on how to handle convoluted references

### Regrets

## Follow-up topics

* Environment Variables - for *nix are all (String,String), how about Windows (@william?)

## Follow-up topics for core group

* backporting - what are thoughts on this and how it would fit use cases and model
* environment variables - an object on its own? what should they include - what other usecases?
  * Environment - an object on its own? (Discuss for consensus) - bring to SPDX tech group
  * Environment also would include VM, container
  * Scope of Environment - what should be included or not
* Provider = (Provider SBOM - service SBOM?) - Nisha to draft topic of discussion here for main tech group

## Action items

* Nisha to come up with a few usecases and examples of Provider class to bring to tech group.

## Notes

* Nisha: in today's VEX meeting, something was brought up around backports. Is this something that should be handled in build or core?
  * backports should their own set of produced SBOMs
  * projects will do backports, linux, zephyr, etc. will do it
  * Conversation for build profile or core? Core discussion

* Environment variables - different use cases, providers, ...
  * Can be nested, runs buildscript, ...
  * provider will be useful as it encodes a lot of additional information
  * provider : here are things that we can provide instance
  * identity of initiating developer - organization
  * Identity of builders - as in "Github", and if later you find out which organization is using that identity to add it to the SBOM
  * Codecov example, multiple layers - build attacking the build script, that executes badly
  * Build consists of:
    * Build inputs
    * Build execution (entrypoint and env)
    * Provider (can have relationships with other providers - i.e. build provider talks to secrets services)
* Provider = (Provider SBOM - service SBOM?)
