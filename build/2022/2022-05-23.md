# SPDX Build meeting = May 23, 2022

## Agenda

* Continue discussion on how to encode config-info and how it maps to the buildimage [SPDX packages] it relates to.

## Attendees

* Brandon Lum
* Sebastian Crane
* David Edelsohn
* Stephen Provine
* Gary O'Neall

## Agenda

* Placeholder
  * Build infrastructure is a package (??? where does this fit)
* WHO Builder (WHO RUNS THE BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE)
  * Clarification on consensus here:
    * Builder (identity as part of new identity model)
* WHERE
      *Build Image of the execution environment (VM/Container), including integrity information (hash)
      * This should be a pointer to a "file"?  or another package?
      * Can be a provider or service
* Continue disucssion on following bullets:
* HOW Build Invocation
  * Build Inputs
    * Build request information, etc.
    * Initatior of build (part of the HOW) (also indentity)
    * [build images] New relationship "BUILT WITH" SPDX Package (which may include services)??
    * Build image - this needs to be clarified, is it the build infrastructure?
      * Package for defining this - can be a container image, VM images, github action (could be service as well)
      * How far do we define this - currently just generic metadata and useful within its own specific context.
    * Build Entrypoint Script (moved from the WHERE section) (part of configinfo)
    * Parameters/Environment variables (part of configinfo)
  * Source Input
    * Source code
    * Packages/dependencies
  * [Optional] Builder Invocation Metadata - need more examples here.   Not completely sure what this means.
  * [Optional] Build Invoker - is the "Button Pusher" - ie. the entity that "Invoked" the build.  other ideas, conjurer, actuator or trigger.
* WHEN
  * Time of build (start/completion)  - this is just 2 timestamps (and align with timestamp in rest of spec)
  * [Optional] Log references - multiple,  link to file.
  * Parameters/Environment variables (part of configinfo) - evaluated references/env variables
* WHAT Output
  * Artifact - output of the build.   Pointer to file.   There may be multiple outputs from one build.
    * Concern is describing self?   Would this be same as what the SBOM has the build info inside it.
    * Probably a good area to write up examples, and see if we can take it from there.
    * Nisha is looking mostly at services at this point.   Kate is looking at embedded/cross compiles, etc.
  * SBOM - this should be a relationship to a file (possibly set of files when multiple aftifact outputs from build).  "DOCUMENT" may work here if needed.
