# SPDX Build meeting = April 25, 2022

## Attendees

* Brandon Lum
* Bob Martin
* Nisha Kumar
* Sebastian Crane

## Agenda

* Continue discussion of data model of Build, and its inputs/outputs, address the issue of generation of the SPDX document as part of the build itself (issue of writing metadata to describe itself), and how to abstract away or provide guidance on how to handle convoluted references

## Follow-up topics

* Environment - an object on its own? (Discuss for consensus) - bring to SPDX tech group
* Environment also would include VM, container
* Environment Variables - for *nix are all (String,String), how about Windows (@william?)
* Scope of Environment - what should be included or not

### Regrets

* Kate and William are not able to make the meeting

## Notes

* In build info file, looks familiar to source material ? What is source material vs build envrionemtn
* Nisha: Currently, no. way of expressing env variables in SPDX. SPDX 2.0 model: everything is a component or a package. Package or a file, and there are relationships between the entities. Nothing that defines what an env variable is?
* Bob: most of what's going to be in build profile is in 3.0 world.
* Environment - an object on its own? (Discuss for consensus)
* Looking at build types (e.g. Github Action)
  * Looking at github yaml - what VM/container image would you like to use? (Is this part of environment?) - multiple levels of that . Network access, type of OS, build arguments, etc.
  * Brandon: is who is building it important to capture the information? (defer to later, see if we can meet the usecases without necessary having this information within the document)
  * Perspective: GIthub Actions is a provider, and uses other providers (such as VMs, such as containers), and then that provider is being triggered by an identity (more of an organization running something)
* Start drafting provider/environment
  * Environment: Do we want everything or a minimum set?
    * Everything that is not part of inputs
    * Define a minimum scope? or how it is used? (Worry about this later?)
    * Environment Variables - for *nix are all (String,String), how about Windows (@william?)
  * Provider: pre-defined infrastructure that you may not know anything about
    *
* Sebastian: if you have 2 separate builds and have similar builds, How can we leverage de-duplication.
* Current draft: Env variable class. Env class 1--contains-->* env variables
