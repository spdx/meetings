## Agenda

- Review standards and specification
  - Enhanced location - elements class
  - Units of measure
- Feedback
- Discuss the elements of a basic HBOM supply chain template
- Introduce requirements

## Notes

- Location class discussion
  - Location is abstract with physical and digital locations
  - Location has time space based on creation
  - Optional time kept as a separate property, this location is valid from time x to y related to an action or transportation
  - Description needs to be added for linked time
  - Creation time is assumed to be the time used if a specific time is not added
  - IP location is an explicit location??
  - Inventory management with specific shelves, etc., is not considered as part of location
- Digital location
  - May need URL
  - Package verification code has a location of a file - for noting
  - Specific way an application is online needs to be considered
  - Relative vs absolute (?)
  - Will be used for Dockers
- Hazard has been added as a hardware artifact
  - Standards Defined hazard
  - Not all hazards may be defined as a standard
  - A new hazard can be defined as a specification
- Unit of measure discussion
  - AI requires change to adopt new units of measure
  - Dimensions is redefined as x, y axis changed - assumes x is always the top of the item
  - Optional feature if cannot be defined
  - shippedIn may define a specific method for shipping a product
  - Use "contained" description for packaging
- Standards and specification
  - Used for functional assurance/safety
  - Supports adherence to a specification via requirements
  - Verification requirement needs to be clarified
  - "requirementsverification" should be the class name
  - Additional properties can be added to requirements
  - Product specification is a group of products - relationship based
- Names of classes not consistent - manufacturer, destroy, not tense consistent
  - Intentional because for action and processes
  - Modify and change actions are examples of confusion
- Potential addition of inventory operations

## Decisions

- A review of the class tenses is required

## Action Items

- Ilan will make additional suggestions related to digital location
