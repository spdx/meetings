## Agenda
1. Review PR changes — specification, specType  
2. Requests to elevate PR to Hardware Profile  
   - Review required prior to elevation  
3. Digital Location discussion  
   - Ilan presentation to form basis for discussion  
4. Case studies for examples  
   - Use examples to model and improve profile  
   - Each participant to develop an example  
5. Conformance considerations within the standard  
6. Group synchronization updates  
   - Functional Safety: slow but progressing  
   - S-AI: working through examples  
7. Hardware grouping  
   - Grouping can be handled with `GroupElement` subclass  
8. Location and regulation-based restrictions — new discussion topic  
9. Operations meeting next week  
   - Conflicts with Hardware meeting; Steven and Alfred to leave mid-session  
10. Tech Team proposal: move evidence to core  
    - **Option 1:** Relationship to relationship (enables evidence added later; supports safety & build profile)  
    - **Option 2:** Property on relationship  
    - **Option 3:** Direct to/from relationship (e.g., *comply to standard* with linked report)

## Notes
- **Specification Discussion:**  
  - Specifications originate from standards bodies  
  - Question raised: Will there be a list of recognized standards bodies?  
  - Diversity of standards organizations noted as a challenge  
  - Specification treated as singular  
  - *specType* considerations discussed  

- **Digital Location:**  
  - Ilan unavailable for discussion this week  

- **Conformance (from Tech Team meeting):**  
  - Relationship-to-relationship model aligns with software and build usage  
  - Special relationship model may require changes to core specification  
  - *To/From* model insufficient for complex relationships  

- **Arduino Presentation:**  
  - Addressed definition of object categories  
  - Explored serialization of objects versus textual definitions  
  - Discussed relationship mappings and included information  
  - DOT representation demonstrated  

- **Information Modeling Challenges:**  
  - Effective communication between high-level and low-level data  
  - Complexity of relationships  
  - Expressing and visualizing complexity  
  - Grouping hardware via **bundle class**  
  - S-AI grouping needs at higher abstraction levels  
  - Training hardware and card/hardware listings  
  - Amit example: focused on hardware capabilities  
  - Emphasis on maintaining business intelligence and traceability within the supply chain  

- **HBOM Connectivity:**  
  - Relationships can connect different HBOMs  
  - Communication of elements remains challenging  
  - Visualization improvements needed (color coding, layering)  
  - Tools required for clarity and traceability

## Decisions
- Recommend adoption of **relationship-to-relationship model** for submission to the Tech Group.  

---

## Action Items
- Focus upcoming sessions on case studies and applied examples.
