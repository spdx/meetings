## Notes
- SPDX v3.1 (cr1) will solve many issues and will be frozen.
- Send message to Kate, Gary, and Alexios regarding truncated minutes.

### ENISA discussion
- SPDX Hardware and Steering Committee content not considered.
- SPDX 2.3 appears to be the version referenced/used.
- Risk analysis focus noted.
- Question raised: What is the real intention of the ENISA document? (Comparison to NSA standards guidance; clarify intent.)
- Profiles need to be updated with effective information:
  - Outreach needs to get profiles updated by group leads.
  - Allan will review material.
- Need to build a supply chain document for the website.
- Open question: Who and what is the process to submit documents to ENISA?
- SPDX submission requires collection of information.
- Karen noted additional documents may require submission (including supply chain).
- Best way to submit is through Karen.
- Concrete suggestions needed.
- Engage profile partners to make suggestions.
- Maintain continuity across EU and US standards and education.
- Karen will help coordinate SBOM guide feedback; described as more of a survey.
  - CRA has four specific documents tied to specific wording.
- Question raised: How will additional profiles planned for v3.1 cr2 be handled?
  - "Coming soon" items now available need to be identified.
- Profile teams must submit profiles:
  - Outreach will resend the profile outline to profile leads for submission.

## Action Items
- Everyone to review and identify issues:
  - Use the minutes for collection or create a separate document.
- Submit changes to ENISA relating to SPDX and other process issues (via the draft points below).
- Send message to Kate, Gary, and Alexios regarding minutes.
- Consider systems engineering concerns (Greg):
  - Argue stages are unclear (example: SBOM completeness; software rollback procedures are not an SBOM issue).
  - Build elements for different stages.
  - Distinguish generation stage vs build elements.
  - Clarify different stakeholder support (TBD).

## Decision
- Karen and Alfred will coordinate document creation and submission.

## ENISA points for discussion and submission (draft components)
- SPDX outdated versions referenced: submit updated version information.
- F.3 Information loss scenarios: incorrect information in multiple locations.
- Systems engineering stages are not clear.
- Example: completeness of SBOMs; software rollback procedures are not an SBOM issue.
  - Build elements for different stages.
  - Distinguish generation stage vs build elements.
  - Clarify different stakeholder support (TBD).
