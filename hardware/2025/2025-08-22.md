## Agenda

* Changes to the hardware/supply chain profile to be discussed
* The Instantiate hardware process is now a subclass of the create process
* Do we need the "instantiatedby" relationship? Can use "hasoutput"
* State action and state process - do we keep them?
* Inspection action location is now optional
* Profile Statement for Supply Chain
* Separate SC from HW in the profile
  * **Option:** A supply chain is the entire network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in the life cycle of a product or service from creation to disposal. It encompasses every phase, from sourcing inputs and components, through manufacturing and assembly, to warehousing, distribution, and final delivery to the end user.
* Change the Use cases
* Plan for next phases - next few weeks

## Notes

* Discussed the separation of HW and the supply chain
* Instantiated moved - instantiatedby no longer needed
* Use the term instantiate rather than instantiation
* ManufacturerProcess should probably be ManufactureProcess
* VM enum added
* Decisions made include the addition of a description of HW and product
* Removed inspection location, hard to determine a location - who and when is important
* Modify removed HW
* State action and process
  * Potentially important in operations
  * State is not an action or process - states are associated with a process "What is the state?"
  * State as output only - may need to use a "verifiedstate" verb as opposed to noun
  * definedstateaction or measuredstateaction
  * definedstateaction is a digest
* Product line vs product - connected
* **Revised definition:**
  * **Option:** A supply chain is the entire network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in the life cycle of a product or service from creation to end-of-life. Supply chains encompass every phase, from sourcing inputs and components, through manufacturing and assembly, to storage, distribution, and final delivery to the end user.

## Action Items

* Merge to dev branch
* Next week Greg wants SC discussed in relation to Zephyr build and reusable sources

## Decision Items

* Revisions accepted
* instantiatedby no longer needed
