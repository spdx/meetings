## Agenda
* PR update https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1098/files
* Product vs Asset
* Product, asset, commodity
* Economic goods

### Product Definition
In this context, the term **"product"** is used in a broad sense to encompass not only conventional finished goods, but also raw materials classified as **commodities** and various forms of **assets** that hold economic value, including software. By adopting this definition, "product" serves as an umbrella term that represents items intended for consumption, inputs/outputs traded in markets, and resources held for investment or future benefit. This inclusive usage allows for clear discussion of concepts that share characteristics across these categories.

* Greg wants SC discussed in relation to Zephyr build and reusable sources
* State PR
* Definition of Supply Chain added to new profile

## Notes
* PR review
* State class added (name, description) - artifact
