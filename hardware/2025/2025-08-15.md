## Agenda

* Need to redo the HW Profile draw.io
* Issue: Merge conflict
* Redo from the Development branch draw.io
* Hardware profile has been approved to be merged into the development branch
* Addition of hardware definition in glossary: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1075
* Any additional questions or thoughts related to the existing HW and supply chain profile
* Question: Should Supply Chain be separated from Hardware Profile? This represented some large changes in structure
* Plan for next phases - next few weeks

## Notes

* Discussion related to definitions in the glossary. The glossary is to be used for the SPDX generation not a description of general terms
* Glossary definition needs to be better defined
* May need a glossary for SPDX in general, where all profiles will add to the glossary
* Out Reach will be responsible for dealing with the glossary issue
* Deal with a few definition issues within the hardware profile
* Supply chain discussion:
  * i.e. Build profile is separate from software
  * Could SC track movement of bites (non material)
  * If separated the SC profile could be used independently of hardware or software
  * What is the impact? Tool builders will be impacted
  * Isaac does not feel he will be impacted by a change
  * Amit needs to contact to obtain feedback on this topic
  * AI needs a supply chain
  * Profile conformance is a key issue
  * Evolution of profiles is better supported if separated
  * SupplyChain is the new profile name
  * "A supply chain is the documentation of the steps related to the creation, transport, and (use or delivery) of a product."
  * Clarifies the scope of SPDX
  * Profile conformance?
  * The supply chain profile documents events and processes associated with the lifecycle of a product, including its creation, transportation, usage, and decommissioning

## Action Items

* Separate the hardware and SC
* Needs to be discussed at a tech meeting on Tuesday

## Decision Items

* Proceed with changes to draw.io
* Separate the hardware and SC
