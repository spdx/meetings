## Agenda
- Review outstanding PR – no outstanding PRs  
- Discuss core requirements used in HW and FuSa  
  - Requirements are considered *core*  
  - A PR will be created to revise HW requirements to coordinate with FuSa requirements  
- Review PR – move requirements from HW and create universal requirements for core  
  - [PR #1073](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1073)  
- Question:  
  - Are there additional requirements needed to satisfy other profiles? Please advise.  
- Develop Use Case examples  
- Any other topics?  

---

## Notes
- Reviewed **New Requirements PR** for *core*.  
  This is a revised definition that considers the requirements for both hardware and FuSa.  
  Please consult the PR for full details.  
- The new requirements include FuSa elements.  
- Amit Kumar approved the use of their implementation examples in the summary and other presentations.  
- Reviewed details related to **SPDX website information**.  
- Discussion on terminology:  
  - The concept of *product* needs revision. Greg noted the difficulty in finding a more generic term for hardware.  
  - “Hardware” as a term may be too narrow; “product” may be broader but harder to define precisely.  
  - SPDX, as a system packaging data exchange, requires a clear articulation of how users can assemble different profiles to define a *system*.  
  - The question remains: *How do we articulate the new definition of hardware as a product?*  
- The **Glossary** needs to be updated to address new and evolving definitions, including those related to hardware and new profiles.  
  - Should the glossary reflect profile definitions?

## Action Items
- [ ] **Glossary Update** – Submit an issue for glossary revision: [Issue #1075](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues/1075)

## Decision Items
- The **new requirements definition** is approved as written.
