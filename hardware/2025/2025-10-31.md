* Wants and needs related to requirements (FUSA discussion): wants are separate from requirements
* Review Arthit Suriyawongkul’s summary of all 3.1 relationships

## Notes

* Hardware discussion updates
* DrawIO updated (core, hardware, SC) – please review
* `relationshipDataPointer` use case
* External documents may contain specific answers via `hasRelationship`
* Machine-readable strategy emphasized
* Custom class may link to other graphs using JSON-LD
* Consideration of other data types (child source, controlled sources)

**CRA Strategy**

* Develop framework of key CRA needs
* Map needs against CRA
* SPDX tools to support internal SPDX and external data
* Treat digital elements as primary data requirements
* Zephyr and Linux implementations as reference points
* Support for product line architectures (e.g., USB charger expansion)
* Git repository PR for CRA map:
  [GitHub Example](https://github.com/gregshue/spdx-examples/tree/conformanceexamples/conformance/example1/content/src)
* Use of Staneslov’s tool for easier creation
* Reference to Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)
* Context: electronic product targeting EU market
* Inclusion of SPA, FCC, UL, SPC regulatory conformance examples
* Common conformance patterns anticipated
* `SDot` / `StrictDot` to generate folder-like structures (drill-down capability)
* Possible integration with Mermaid UML (mermaid.js.org)
* Interface standards and agent representation breakdowns
* Mapping wants/needs to SPDX
* Logical view alignment with SPDX
* Environmental constraints consideration
* Conformance examples may become part of SPDX repository (Kate or Gary to confirm)
