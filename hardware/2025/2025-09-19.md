## Notes
* Product supply chains need to be concrete. How did I get this product? Who, where, how
* Supply chain is a chain of supply chains dependent upon need and location in the supply chain. Different owners, buyers, sellers, and users
* Integrators need information related to options, locations, origin, price and cost
* Product line needs to be refined in meaning
* Addition to the idea product line -
* Family of products with a specific SKU
* Design and planning require a survey of products and related products
* SKU - stock keeping unit (not a specific unit)
* A specific product is a unit
* Specific unit, product SKU information, followed by a grouping of SKUs
* When you deal with different manufacturers, ideas are broken (abstraction is not useful)
* Product source - location and specifications - impacts selection and business processes

### Types of Products
* Abstraction of specification - engineering processes
* Product line (specific manufacturer), different SKU
* Product Specification - same SKU, model
* Specific product unit - SN

## Action Items
* Review information related to product lines, abstractions, etc

## Decision Items
* (None recorded)
