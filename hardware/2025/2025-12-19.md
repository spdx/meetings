## Notes

* **Allan Friedman:** Produced a statement related to hardware ([LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanafriedman/)).
* **Release Status:** Formal release of 3.1 will be at FOSDOM at the end of January, as requested by Issac.
* **ISO Certification:** Currently in process with V3.0.
* **Renaming:** "System Engineering" will be the new name for the Safety Profile.
* **Mapping:** Question raised regarding whether we are approaching the CSR and SPDX mapping issue effectively.
* **Spec Review (Greg):** * Product engineering uses a **W-model**.
* New guidance from EU: [EU Survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/ENISA-TG-2025-01) and [ENISA Technical Advisory (Package Managers)](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-12/ENISA%20Technical%20Advisory%20-%20Package_Managers_v_0.8_draft.pdf).


* **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Discussion:**
* System Engineering model is important for approaching CRA needs in a coordinated manner.
* CRA expects products to meet regulations (laws) similar to rail transportation or aviation.
* Requires specific artifacts for design, development, and production; emphasizes engineering over "crafting."
* **Karen:** Noted there is no specific life cycle designation in CRA.
* Artifacts can be created via any approach (e.g., waterfall, top-down with circulation pump). Reassessment is required.
* CRA is based on risk scope.


* **Product Scope:** The group needs to define the product scope.
* **SPDX Utility:** Can SPDX fulfill the needs of product manufacturers? Submit conformance requirements.
* **Cross-Profile Impact:** This issue will touch on a number of profiles.
* **Process Considerations:** Engineering processes supported by numerous organizations need to be considered. How will these be expressed in SPDX?
