# SPDX Hardware Team Meeting 2025-06-27

## Attendees

* Alfred Strauch
* Amit Kumar
* Bob Martin
* Victor Lu
* Steven Carbno
* Riley Barello-Myers
* Isaac Asay
* Jim Vitrano
* Lucas Tate

## Agenda

* Tech Team report for moving Hardware Profile to merge into development
  * Any items to be cleaned up - please review the profile in detail
  * Tech Team will provide a date next week
* Review of islocatedAt - build definition
* islocatedAt : For ever from `element` located at a specific to `location`. A time period is optional.
* generalized to elements or agent specific?
* specification class Update #1028 optional parameters
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1028/files
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1024/files - Arthit Suriyawongkul
* remove not needed class "Action Event Data" #1033
  * https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1033 - Needs to signed off by Gary or Kate

## Notes

* Need a road map and check points for next phases for the Hardware WG
* Should "islocatedAt" be usable by any element?
  * No need to restrict to agent
  * ie storage, installation, in use or agent action
  * new relationship type - to and from
  * likened to location log
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/1028/files needs to merged - update a property name
* Request for PR 1033
* Functional safety needs to be part of HW BOM - compliance - proof000
* Operations are HW has connection related to configuration ie VM
* Cancel meeting next week - holidays

## Action Items

* PR will be added to implement "islocatedAt"
* Arthit Suriyawongkul will be contacted to complete PR
* Code structure needs to be reviewed in detail
* Review of profile will be assigned for review by sections:

**Instructions:**
Requirement: We need to ensure each description is clear, accurate and relevant. In the event a class appears to not be relevant, please note the reason why and any recommendations related to that class.
Process: Please review at your convenience. Once completed, please submit the recommendation document to the HW group list. spdx-hardware@lists.spdx.org before the next meeting on July 11.
Review process: Review summary and description for clarity. Ensure relationships are relevant and accurate. If a potential relationship should be included please note the enhancement.
