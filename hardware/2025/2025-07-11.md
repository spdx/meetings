# SPDX Hardware Team Meeting 2025-07-11

## Attendees

* Alfred Strauch
* Steven Carbno
* Bob Martin (MITRE)
* Dishoungh White II
* Kate Stuart
* Victor Lu
* Jim Vitrano
* Amit Kumar
* Isaac Asay
* Lucas Tate

## Agenda

* Review PRs - old and new
* Tech Team report hardware Profile update
* Review Relationship issues (found during review)
  * islocatedAt: For ever from `element` located at a specific to `location`. A time period is optional.
  * affects - right for Vulnerability only.
  * creatorBy - we need to add
  * hasOutput - right now is build only but should change
  * hasInput- right now is build only but should change
  * hasResolution- we need to add.
* Review Hardware Profile Description and summary update:

**Old Summary**
The Hardware Profile provides additional metadata that is useful for hardware.

**Revised 25-07-11**
The Hardware Profile provides metadata that describes hardware and its supply chain.

**Old Description**
The Hardware namespace defines concepts related to hardware, including virtual hardware, supply chain and its characteristics.

**Revised Description 25-07-11**
The Hardware namespace defines metadata related to physical and virtual hardware including its supply chain and properties.

**New Summary**
The hardware profile provides physical and virtual hardware metadata from components and the source of any component within a defined supply chain.

**New Description**
The hardware namespace supports the detailed definition of physical and virtual hardware representation of hardware through the documentation of metadata. The hardware supply chain supports the supply chain detail based on component level and component decomposition.

* Review Action Items assignments: as seen below (see assigned action items)
* Next step for HW WG
  * Work through some examples (volunteers?)
  * Core examples

## Notes

* Provided a walk through of HBOM and SC for Dishoungh White II
  * will provide use cases for next meeting
* Noted that Amit provided feedback related to assignment on revisions
* Reviewed profile updates
* Reviewing Amit's Notes:
  * Creation action will not be changed at this time
* Product vs hardware - product is best choice
* CreationProcess vocabulary will be changed as suggested by Amit - Summary needs to have fewer - remove "abstract process class" to simplify
* Assembly process description -
* HarvestAction change to match HarvestProcess
* Action Taken as a term in the action class description
* New assignment - Provide Use cases for addition to release information

## Assigned Action Items

Review of profile will be assigned for review by sections:

**Instructions:**
Requirement: We need to ensure each description is clear, accurate and relevant. In the event a class appears to not be relevant, please note the reason why and any recommendations related to that class.
Process: Please review at your convenience. Once completed, please submit the recommendation document to the HW group list. spdx-hardware@lists.spdx.org before the next meeting on July 11.
Review process: Review summary and description for clarity. Ensure relationships are relevant and accurate. If a potential relationship should be included please note the enhancement.
