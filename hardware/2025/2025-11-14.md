- Agenda sent to Tech, Threat/Controls, Functional Design, Security, AI, and Operations groups.
- Notify anyone who should attend based on compliance/regulatory expertise.
- **Goal**
  - Define compliance, regulations, and policy.
  - Create a method for compliance.
  - Establish criteria to define examples and methods to adhere to compliance.
  - Agree upon criteria for validating requirements, examples, and solution outlines.
- **Objectives**

## Notes
- Collective information set and SPDX mapping model need definition.
- Identify conformance documents.
- KubeCon featured related ontology and graph-language discussions.
- Units-of-measure PR:  
  - Recommendation: keep units as simple strings.  
  - Consider machine readability and error-handling requirements.
- **Goal:** Define conformance to specific regulations.  
  Focus includes:
  - Auditing approach  
  - Pointers to information sources  
  - Vulnerability handling  
  - User documentation  
  - Document/artifact linking to process-assessment mapping  
- SBOM alone may not satisfy CRA; additional transparency is required.
- Compliance, regulations, and policy must be defined as requirements.
- Can SPDX satisfy regulatory requirements? Mapping needed.
- SPDX elements will be identified as compliance elements.
- Operations contributes significantly to regulatory conformance.  
  “Conformance” is preferred to “compliance.”
- Establish criteria and examples for CRA conformance.
- Elements may vary by situation or business context.
- Define how SPDX data/tools can link to requirements.
- Create reference examples for completing CRA documents.
- Separate steward and manufacturer responsibilities.
- Outline must define clauses, fields, and population methods.

## Action Items
- **Kate Stewart:** Consider a spreadsheet as the starting point.  
- **Karen Bennett:** Integrate Kate’s content into her spreadsheet.  
- **Greg Shue:** Submit PR for commodity device conformity example:  
  https://github.com/spdx/spdx-examples/pull/123

## Decision Items
- Units of measure must include an error-handling process in the documentation.
- Starting point will be a spreadsheet.
