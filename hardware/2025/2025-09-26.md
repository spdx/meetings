## Notes

### CRA Discussion
* CRA is the largest change in IT for 35 years
* Requires mission critical processes for all products
* Requires a new type of expertise to meet the needs of cyber security on a global scale
* CRA content application to SPDX

### Product Specification
* Product # needs a range of #s
* This version or sub-components may be another supplier's product
* Composition requires additional relationship information inclusion tree
* Need multiple product #s
* What information will be included in each specification?
* Do we need an agent related to this product specification? Covered in artifacts -- originatedBy - Mandatory property? (no) Originator vs maintainer - is the originator known
* Do we need a spec version? Yes
* 2 versions -- product and spec
* Spec is a core element
* Do we need a category or classification? Meaning of the name - intended use for CRA
* Does "Product Specification" need to be part of a core? Item version
* How much of this product information do you need to disclose?
* Processes for consistency
* Information authorization
* Alex - Securing information is outside the scope of SPDX - SC has some interest related to security

## Action Items
* Product specification discussion related to the core
* Item version - all profiles
* Example use of SPDX for CRA conformance - Greg's document needs to be reviewed https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t-L2yt-zYLT3mtWC63Dy0PCl0G52NTJhsV_P26BV9oo/edit?tab=t.0

## Decision Items
* Need to merge all the PRs into hardware
