## Notes
* **Group Naming:** Marcel suggested renaming the group to better reflect conformance and compliance.
    * What is the true description of the group's need?
    * Need to consolidate feedback related to various groups.
    * Conclusion: The naming issue is not a problem in the end; it is a communication problem.
* **Releases:** Reviewed PR and V3.1 (rc1) release is imminent.
* **CRA & User Information (Greg Shue review of spreadsheet):**
    * Discussion on minimum content related to user information.
    * **Item 9:** SBOM information must be available to users (requires clarification of user information vs. SBOM definition).
    * Content must be user-readable and available on printed material as well as electronic.
    * *Note:* CRA definitions may differ; CRA specifically requires human-readable information.
    * SPDX definition is currently outside the scope of the CRA definition.
* **Defining "Human-Readable":**
    * Refers to rendered information.
    * May be related to bar-codes or QR-codes (not part of BOM information).
* **Security & Engineering:**
    * Security requires the delivery of digital information in a secure manner for use.
    * Said information must exist in a physical form (exists in SPDX - see Page 70 of the document).
    * **Intended Purpose:** Impacts the engineering process and foreseeable misuse (impacts design process).
    * **Conformity:** End data support period (5 years min.), detailed instructions, default settings, automatic security updates are all user-related issues.
* **Open Questions:**
    * What is the format of a package to meet conformance requirements to CRA?
    * What is the best way to deal with the information sets needed in CRA as related to System Engineering?
