## Agenda
- **Problem from Isaac – Category field**

- **Discussion:** Definition of “hardware” vs. related terms (Greg Shue)  
  Reference: *Software and Systems Engineering Vocabulary (SEVOCAB)*  
  - *Hardware:* (1) Physical equipment used to process, store, or transmit computer programs or data.  
  - Observation: This appears too narrow, limited to computer hardware only, excluding virtual hardware.  

  **Proposed New Definition:**  
  *Hardware is any product, real or virtual. A product is tangible and is the result of labor, or of a natural or artificial process.*

- **No new PRs**

### Actions and Processes
**References:**  
- [OutOfSpecAction.md](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/profile-hardware/model/Hardware/Classes/OutOfSpecAction.md)  
- [ResolutionAction.md](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/profile-hardware/model/Hardware/Classes/ResolutionAction.md)

**Definition Enhancement:**  
*OutOfSpecAction* refers to a situation where a product, material, environment, or process fails to meet established standards or predefined specifications—or exceeds specification parameters.  
Any result or condition that goes beyond these predefined thresholds is considered “out of specification,” indicating a non-conformance or deviation that must be investigated and addressed to maintain product quality and regulatory compliance.  
This term is used in industries such as manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, quality control, and regulatory compliance.

**Resolution Issues Identified:**  
- Relationship type `resolution` is undefined.  
- “Resolution” is not a suitable name for the relationship type.  

**Solution:**  
- Existing: “For each `ResolutionAction` there is at least one `/Core/Relationship` class or subclass with the `relationshipType` of ‘resolved’ on the *from* and an `OutOfSpecAction` class or subclass on the *to*.”  
- Change: Use `resolved` instead of `resolution`.  
- Definition of `resolved`: The *to* `OutOfSpecAction` is resolved in the *from* `ResolutionAction`.

### HW Process and Virtualization
**Update Required for Definition of “Instantiated”**  
- **Old:** `InstantiatedBy` – The *to* Element is instantiated by the *from* Process.  
- **New:** `InstantiatedBy` – The *to* Element is instantiated by the *from* DefinedProcess.

**References:**  
- [productAgent.md](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/profile-hardware/model/Hardware/Properties/productAgent.md)  
  - **Old Summary:** Product Manufacture Name and related information.  
  - **New Summary:** The Agent responsible for product branding such as an OEM.  
  - **Description:** The Agent defines partNumber, batchNumber, or serialNumber of the unit of hardware.

- [additionalInformation.md](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/blob/profile-hardware/model/Hardware/Properties/additionalInformation.md)  
  - **Old Description:** Provides relevant information to the product.  
  - **New Description:** Provides relevant information *about* the product.

## Notes
- Hardware types – JSON representation issue with `definedType` field `type`.  
  Conflict prevents JSON-LD serialization.  
  **Solution:** Use option `nameFromSource`.  
  Agreed name change: `typeFromSource`.

- **Vocabulary definition of hardware:**  
  Greg Shue provided various definitions for computing, hardware, and devices.  
  - Hardware is often used as a synonym for “product.”  
  - When is something *computer hardware*?

  **Proposed Vocabulary Definition:**  
  *Hardware is any product, real or virtual. A product is tangible, immutable, and the result of labor, or of a natural or artificial process. Any software product installed on a piece of hardware and made immutable becomes hardware.*

  - Hardware is a device.  
  - *Device:* (1) Mechanism or piece of equipment designed to serve a purpose or perform a function.  
  - Once a chip with code is made immutable, it becomes hardware—a state change in its lifecycle.

- All recommended HW profile changes above are **approved as written**.

- **Bundle vs. “Contains”**  
  - *Bundle* describes a standard or non-standard set of elements.  
  - *Contains* describes an assembly or grouping of specific elements.

## Action Items
- [ ] Produce one or more PRs to submit approved changes.

## Decision Items
- Discussion on the definition of “hardware” and “product” is required.  
- No further revisions needed.
