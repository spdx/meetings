## Attendees

- Monty Wiseman
- Henk Birkholz
- Amit Kumar
- Alfred Strauch
- Steven Carbno
- Nicole Pappler
- Jim Virano

## Agenda

- Review the Tech team comments related to HBOM submission
  - https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/pull/947/files#diff-a79781cb8974f2959810df5fa33172129e38dc4c86885a113e502b3897cc2090
- Improve the definition of "Process"
  - Should we have multiple hardware sub classes
  - Physical would be removed from hardware class to become a sub class
  - Virtual would become a separate sub class
  - A subclass may be used to define an abstract type (hammer) rather than a specific hammer. "Generic"
  - Organization entity may become a relationship
- Review Action Methodology for hardware supply chain
  - Review and discuss slides

## Notes

- Review of the Tech Team comments of the REPO review
  - Hardware class and process class
  - Recommendation was creation of a hardware abstract class
  - Subclasses would be physical hardware and virtual hardware
- When do you use vh - does an OS create vh?
- What is the relationship to vh and software - instantiation process linkage
  - Process instantiation is part of the change related to SPDX
  - Does a VH have a unique ID (SIN)? What do you do related to duplicate IDs?
- Discussion related to the Tech Team role and process related to approval of HBOM profile
  - HBOM may be approved for use this quarter
- Action Methodology discussion
  - Abstract, industry abstract and industry instantiated model
  - Interest related to the development of the Action Methodology

## Decisions

- Agreed to hardware change related to the creation of an abstract hardware class
- Agreed that an enhanced definition of process is required and approved

## Action Items

- Enhancement of the HBOM Repo based on the HBOM team and the Tech Team
- Participation in the Action Methodology
