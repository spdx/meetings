* New PR for Action Event Data will be removed as a class
* Location discussion - "isAt" and "hasLocation"
  * isAt is a time window definition of location
  * what is impact of isAt - virtual vs physical
  * is "islocatedAt" a better designator
  * is there a exclusivity issue - islocatedAt vs has locatedAt (multiple locations)
  * From this item to a location(s) - 1 to 1 defines as exclusive
