## Agenda 
* **Approve previous minutes:** [Pull Request #1043](https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/1043)
* **Review PRs:** No open PRs.
* **FOSDEM Conference:** Can someone speak to the experience?
* **CRA Spreadsheet Review:** Review and add comments/suggestions to the [CRA Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10KdQTkXH3K-kp1zD7wIhuSUc91U8ttm7gVZ0BEVC004/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
* **Spreadsheet Enhancements:** Discuss Annex VII with Greg (Ref: [OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)).
* **Weekly Topic:** Annex VII Clause 3 - Cybersecurity assessment.
    * Document key issues in the spreadsheet.
    * Map issues into SEBok requirement statements.

## Notes
* **ANNEX I Discussion:** Refer to the [Support Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dBOt7Ul6ClUaFuMvMsa2HdeDEYVEulH8PQGeGrA9zWQ/edit?hl=en&tab=t.0).
* **Cyber Threats:** Discussion on cyber vs. non-cyber threats.
    * Firmware updates may create threats (e.g., DOS attacks); requires examples of cascading issues.
    * New processes required (e.g., door lock updates).
* **Configuration & Assessment:**
    * Default configurations require risk assessments and security statements.
    * Vulnerability is defined as a weakness related to other systems; context-dependent but universally recognized in tech security.
    * SPDX doesn't need to define *how* to assess, just how to record it.
* **Practicality:** Focus on being practical over perfect. Identify the top ~20 actions needed for assessments.
* **Design & Scope:**
    * Recording of reasonable use, intent, scope, and usage is vital as assumptions are based on these.
    * Update servers and remote services are considered extensions of the product solution (product context).
* **SPDX Strategy:**
    * Map what SPDX can do today vs. what needs to be added later.
    * Linkages should be included in the SPDX reference as human-readable issues.
    * Scope off "element collections" to accommodate hardware, software, and services.
* **Documentation:** User guides could be a specification, a file link, or a snippet (using reference IDs or external IDs).
* **AI & Risk:**
    * Intended purpose of AI is a useful metric.
    * Risk level is a mandatory CRA requirement; consider which AI elements belong in the core.

## Action Items
* [ ] **Operations Coordination:** Work with Operations regarding products, intent, and projects.
* [ ] **Feature Audit:** List SPDX options that can be used for CRA with limited changes (Review next week).
* [ ] **Risk Levels:** Define/evaluate IE risk levels.
* [ ] **Release Scoping:** Determine the data points to capture for the first release.

## Decision Items
* **Primary Focus:** Prioritize what can be achieved within SPDX for CRA compliance using existing tools.
* **Operations Sync:** Discuss "intended use" parameters with the operations team.
