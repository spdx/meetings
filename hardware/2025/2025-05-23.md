* Ilan Schifter will continue discussion on digital location
  * location will have minimal attributes
  * physical location will be contain attributes
  * digital location will be expanded based on research and agreement by group

## Notes

* Name space conversation focused on use in hardware only
  * will be used in conjunction with location
* External identifiers in HW HS codes (Global hardware, GS1, org IDs)
  * entry name can be added to PR
  * need to reference another SPDX doc.
  * external reference outside SPDX
  * externalMap is a pointer to SPDX related components
* Location requires a point a reference point - starting point
  * ie CAN bus link point is a reference point - other points are in reference to that point
  * Location will have optional start and end times
* PRs
  * taxonomy or name space for groups of items. What is a CPU?
  * taxonomy name is confusing
  * defines object sets as opposed to structures
  * Provide an example in PR
  * What is a defined "Hazard" or "Taxonomy"? Definition and value
  * "Defined Element" or type - link from defined object - "External definition"
  * "DefinedType" definition - hazard and taxonomy

## Decisions

* "DefinedType" definition - hazard and taxonomy

## Action Items

* Amit's list of identifiers will be sent to HW list and we will create a PR for next week
