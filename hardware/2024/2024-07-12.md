## Attendees
* Alfred Strauch
* Steven Carbno
* Amit Kumar
* Isaac Asay
* Kate Stewart
* Tito Dakshinamoon
* A.J. Stein (NIST)

## Agenda
* AJ to present on Constraints
* Michael Gielda to show model

## Notes
* OSCAL - Ianguage that is information model encoded in XML.
* Metaschema modeling framework, so not doing it by hand, understanding equivalence and relationship between each other.   What does this have to do with Structured constraints?    Schema enforcement limits are possible.    So, how build information that is conditional.   XML & JSON schema can enforce only up to a limit.

* Metapath is modern implmentations of xpath.   Subset of xpath behaviour, to help with searching the target.   ie. if I'm in memory, show me all the results that, ....    Able to do relative search in heirachical as well as global. 
* Resolution of idiomatic XML to JSON translation.
* Powerful, as it has tool that can automatically generate code in JAVA for instance.
* Useful for cross reference parallel items.
* Complexitity between state management
* Metapath looking at adding another data processing layer.     Supports a default; as well as telling if right or how it's done it wrong.    Can build software to filter it. 
* https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema/tutorials/3-constraints-expect/Uses HUGO with markdown for the tutorial generation. 
* May be possible to generate in SHACL/TURTL - but temperature points may require  going to formal.  Correctness mechanisms.   Intra and Inter documents to analyzed.   Understand.
* At a certain level of complexity for constraints, may need to go to something like the constraints.

* Michael gave a demonstration of https://designer.antmicro.com/ - this is the "new" thing that replaces renopedia.
