## Attendees
* Alfred Strauch
* Steven Carbno
* Amit
* Isaac Asay
* Nicole Pappler

## Agenda
* Review notes related to instantiation
* Review Constraints as an element - move to relationship
* Address functional safety in relation to HBOMs
  * Defining compliance related to functional safety used
  * Compliance is a broader safety issue
* Review new hardware class descriptions starting on slide 19 - part of SPDX submission

## Notes
* Discussed instantiation - agreed that instantiation works for VM
* Discussed constraint - agreed constraints is a separate class
* Reviewed classes of HBOM
* VM - should there be a SKU for VH?
  * Related to a specific hardware
  * Can use the software SKU
  * Can use SKU related to the hardware
* Component name needs to be a part number
* Batch or serial number must exist per unit of hardware

## Decisions
* Agreed that instantiation works for VM
* Component version changed to version
* Component name changed to part number (SKU)
* Agreed constraints is a relationship
* VH needs a version and SKU
* Product dimensions is a problem based on interpretation of length and orientation
* Revisions will be made, provided to group and submission made to SPDX Tech Team
* Dec 27 and Jan 3 no meetings

## Action Items
* Review the notion of dimensions based on industry discussions
  * Consider x,y,z
