* Alfred Strauch
* Bob Martin (MITRE)

* runsON - does runsON apply to a binary only?
* Discuss the nature of "Actions"
* Need to include safety and security action
* Do we cancel next week's meeting? US Thanksgiving

## Notes

### Discussion
* Review hardware/vm elements
* runsON - binary - no python/Java - os is required
* There is a dependency - external libs, can make statements related to dependencies
* Runtime components can have dependencies
* Discussed three key relationships - "runsON, dependsON, contains" Do we need any other relationships
* Discussion of slide 3 related to VM - do we need to have a VM dependsON hardware - as in FPGAs
* Confusion related to runsON with software running on VM (may not have dependency)
  * Created example with FPGA
  * Created hardware example
  * runsON and dependsON need clear definition
* Generates is a 1 X event
  * There are dynamic situations related to generates - "Is a instantiation or continuous process"
  * New words related generates - spawns, emanates, manages (defines)
* What is the understanding level - embedded knowledge is required

## Action Items
* Define an additional term for generates related continuous generation - common criteria
* Ongoing action conversation
