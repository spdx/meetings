# SPDX Hardware Team Meeting 2024-12-06

## Attendees
* Alfred Strauch
* Bob Martin (MITRE)
* Steven Carbno
* Monty Wiseman
* Isaac Asay
* Jim Vitrano

## Agenda
* Discuss term "generates"
  * New words related generates - spawns, emulates, manages (defines)
  * "Is a instantiation or continuous process"
  * Add a new maintains relationship? Have 2 relationship for VH?
* Review method for defining "Assembly", "Build" and supply chain events
  * Presentation of work related to FuSa

## Discussion
* Xen to disk to VM requires another process (Monty)
* Add Action called instantiation
* Moved to discussion of assembly - instance vs process
  * Instantiation processes deal with process requirements
  * Hardware build is the action (instance) of build
  * Instantiation is the assembly process
  * Process instantiation sometimes requires instantiation
  * DependsOn replaces generates
  * Instantiated in the incident

### Definition of Instantiation
(From) Process element to any element  
(To) To an element instantiated by a process element

### 2 Types of Supply Chain Issues
1. A specific product is associated with an action (event)
2. An abstract product (type) is defined in process

### Definitions
* An event with a date is an action
* A process defines a set of requirements. A plan is a process. A standard or specification is a process
* Assembly instructions are processes
* Actions can be associated with process

## Action Items
* Review UN document related to "Actions"
* Build HBOM base elements

## Discussion
* Definition of Instantiation: (From) Process element to any element  
  (To) To an element instantiated by a process element
* Instantiation defines process used to create VH
* Process elements is connected has a relationship called DependsOn related to elements
* Finalize HBOM spec
* Present spec to Tech Team as part of a presentation
* Supply chain discussion runs parallel to HBOM conversation - much broader conversation
  * Other parties may need to be included in conversation
