## Agenda: 
* Work out details of outcome of last week's workshop
  * Recap of workshop discussion
  * Define text for SWID section 
  * Define text for GitBom section

## Notes
* GitBOM section updated by Jeff and considered complete.
* Determining SWID reference type specifics:
  * Henk: What if the SWID locator is not text? (i.e. bytes?). SWID tag ID can be a 60 byte string that cannot be represented in text but it can be base 64 encoded in a text file.
  * Thomas: We will ad a note to encode base 64 in the spec.
  * Thomas: what value do we want to use for "RefType" keyword? 
  * Henk: `swid` is fine
  * Thomas: SWID locator format? Can we specify this?
  * Henk: Recommendation in SWID spec:  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Software-Identification-SWID
  * Thomas: can we link to SWID URI scheme: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sacm-coswid-21.html#name-uri-schemes? (Henk confirms)
  * Thomas: Any futher comments on SWID?
  * Karsten: trouble with the security type here. SWID is another identifier.
  * Bob: `swid` is replacement for `cpe` which is already under "security", so should be consistent with where cpe is now.
  * Jeff: There's no introduction section to persistent ID. We could add a description and caveats with direction to other identifiers in section [F.2](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/external-repository-identifiers/#f2-security). 
  * Thomas: Probably better to put a note in the introduction section [F.1](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/external-repository-identifiers/#f1-introduction) since that is most likely what people will read first. How should we word it? Jeff TODO: will add to the notes.
* Advisory/fix/url: What do we do for the locator format?
  * Dick: you could refer it to the url RFC: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
  * Jeff: you could also use the uri RFC: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3
  * Bob: 3.0 discussion mostly around URIs
  * Dick: URIs are not always retrievable/downloadable.
  * Rose: Do they need to be? URLs might not be retrievable by everyone all the time (i.e. behind a company firewall) - does it just need to be retrievable by one person?
  * Jeff: maybe constrain to URL for now and we can widen the definition in the future if necessary
* Dick: Concern about "impact statement" in advisory. Term that is used/defined context in research papers but does not really exist in the cyber security world. *agreement to return to this subject later in the meeting*
* Thomas: We need a dedicated security-focused appendix somewhere. We could also add to [Annex F](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/external-repository-identifiers/): "External Repository Identifier". Or, we can just add more examples in Annex F.
* Jeff: how do we provide guidance about security - there has been lots of discussions about this recently.
* Thomas and Anthony: changing the spec will be difficult (if we add an Annex) and if it needs to be updated.
* Thomas: bring to tech call that additional guidance is needed. Ask where should we place this and see what they say. We need space for security guidance. 
* Thomas: Option 3 wording - ok to have it in the implemtation guidance?
* Henk: does not prefer implementation guidance in the spec (others agree). Would prefer to have it all in one place.
* Thomas: should we add "option 3 from the [SPDX 2.x Defects Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9lOwYrpVlmxBl_cEahZTMeo0gU6yDxkgSbx4I5K5v4/edit#heading=h.ek1vb9m2b24v)] text" (massaged a bit) at the top of the "security" section for appendix F? yes
* TODO: Thomas to open the PR summarizing what we have agreed upon in this call.
  * Update: https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/658
