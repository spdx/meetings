## Notes
### Approve meeting minutes from last two meetings
* https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/273 - Approved

### OpenVEX
* OpenVEX was [announced](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/accelerate-vex-adoption-through-openvex)
  * https://github.com/openvex/spec
* CISA VEX, SPDX VEX, CycloneDX VEX and OpenVEX now exist
  * SPDX is it's own implementation? It will be - easy translation between CISA VEX
* VEX roles seem to be standard strings for OpenVEX - should've been an enum - strings don't specify how, what and why
* Vulnerability and advisory would be a relationship in SPDX. OpenVEX sees it more as a data feed that is separate - completely loose from an SBOM, using purls.
* How do we link this to SPDX docs? Link as external refs - OpenVEX doc would techincaly be an `advisory` (you could also use `url`)
* CSAF stuff is free format text which is really hard to parse. enums would be easier to parse and process
* Link to CVE or URL, but how will we find references to this? This assumes that the consumer knows all the well known identifiers
* Timestamp is non standard format (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended-07.html)
* To have a fourth VEX implementation is a litle concerning (with no defects group consultation)
* Concern about the messaging of this announcement and how it will affect SPDX adoption
* Rose and Jeff asked to maintainers for OpenVEX, can bring concerns to OpenVEX maintainers
* OpenVEX points to vulnerability - where can I find this? and product (purl) - how do I find the SBOM for this?
* What does the governments model look like? How do we support open source/startup as well as larger commercial vendors - this is not just a vulnerability problem; this is a balancing act in all aspects of software development.
* In order to understand the inventory of software, we need some standards and this is the same thing happening in vulnerability space right now. 
* Need mapping table from CSAF to CycloneDX and add OpenVEX
* NIST VDR links:
  * NIST SP 800-161 RA-5; https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf 
* CycloneDX VDR Support: https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr/
* What is a NIST VDR: (has link to open source VDR examples):
    * https://energycentral.com/c/pip/what-nist-sbom-vulnerability-disclosure-report-vdr
* JSON version Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/master/SBOMVDR_JSON/VDR_118.json
