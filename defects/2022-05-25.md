## Notes
### Approval of meeting minutes from last week
* https://github.com/spdx/meetings/pull/158 - Approved by TS, will merge once GH is back up

### Update on Defects contributions to 2.3 Spec
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/658 - Merged
* https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/pull/670 -  Annex G with security scenarios was merged
  * Likely will be changes to this Annex coming in the future - Alexios is adding another licensing namespace section and Rose/Kate are adding "Minimum elements for an SBOM" section
  * If you would like to see changes to the security annex we already merged, open a new PR with changes
 
 ### Continue work on Defects Profile in 3.0 Spec
* Past charter work: https://docs.google.com/document/d/189VtcPVCVZGl5j1NZL4HTO54iQAWtVwn6wcDHkDiHFQ/edit#heading=h.zfxltakh9dr
* Past NTIA 3T SBOM Defects scenarios work: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XOyEOHJBQ-7RA3vFrJzNTsMJSeZBIvNo1Z3pNWk16U/edit?usp=sharing
* Fresh document to create 3.0 Usage Scenarios: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUgIbQbR3veBzT48XzUVZDddBtvjj05ibNxI1dzdRKw/edit?usp=sharing
* Rose: Should we start with the 2.3 scenarios and re-imagine them for 3.0?
* Jeff: What other things do we need to do with respect to the charter? Just waiting for feedback?
  * Thomas: will approve exisitng suggestions in the document and send out for review
* Thomas: copied usage scenarios from 2.3 into 3.0 Defects Usage Scenarios document to begin drafting
* Jeff: for right now, we have a scope that says we will start with usage scenarios. When we get to the next thing we need to do, we will cross that off but where do we keep track of our progress over time?
* Thomas: Was thinking we will just use the google docs, maybe setup a punch list document where people can add things in that we can work our way through
* Jeff: I think that would work
* Consensus to add the punch list to usage scenarios document
* Rose: we had discussed sending out request for feedback to the community to make sure we have all the usage scenarios covered -- volunteers to take this on and send out to SPDX tech list
* Jeff: we've defined certain content we know we want to include, but maybe looking through 3T scenarios and trying to prioritize those are where we want to start. Some of them may be interesting but far our, but let's start with are we using 3T SBOM scenarios.
* Henk: does a SPDX 3.0 security profile count as an SBOM?
  * Jeff: we are first trying to align on what is the usage scenario then we can circle back to that.
* *Group discussion about usage scenarios with decisions being documented in the [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUgIbQbR3veBzT48XzUVZDddBtvjj05ibNxI1dzdRKw/edit?usp=sharing)*
