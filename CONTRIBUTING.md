# Contributing to the SPDX Meeting Repository

## General

Each team maintains their own minutes directory.

If a team has conventions different from the conventions documented in this file, they should include a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the top level of their directory.

## File Naming Conventions

For meeting minutes organization and sorting purpose:

- Meeting minutes should be titled using the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Meeting minutes should be stored in a directory named for the year `YYYY`.
- Additional files relevant to a meeting minutes `YYYY-MM-DD.md` should be
  named as `YYYY-MM-DD-relevant-file-label.md` (e.g., `2024-12-24-diagram.md`),
  and stored in the same `YYYY` directory.

## Pull Requests

New meeting minutes should be added as a pull request.
Sufficient time should be allowed for review before merging.
It is suggested that there is at least one review from an attendee of the meeting, but even if no reviews, it should be merged before the next meeting.
