# Contributing to the SPDX Meeting Repository
## General
Each team maintains their own minutes directory.
If a team has conventions different from the conventions documented in this file, they should include a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the top level of their directory.
## File Naming Conventions
Meeting minutes are titled by the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
At the end of the year, that year's files should be moved into a directory named for that year `YYYY`.
## Pull Requests
New meeting minutes should be added as a pull request.
Sufficient time should be allowed for review before merging.
It is suggested that there is at least one review from an attendee of the meeting, but even if no reviews, it should be merged before the next meeting.
