# Contributing to the SPDX Meeting Repository
## General
Each team maintains their own minutes directory.
If a team has conventions different from the conventions documented in this file, they should include a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the top level of their directory.
## File Naming Conventions
Meeting minutes are titled by the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
At the end of the year, that year's files should be moved into a directory named for that year `YYYY`.
## Pull Requests
New meetings should be added as a pull request.
One week should be allowed for review.
It is suggested there is one review from an attendee of the meeting before merging, but if no one reviews within 2 weeks it should be merged.
